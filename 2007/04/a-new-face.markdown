I've updated the theme for our site. You might notice the interactive archives at the bottom of the page and the swanky flickr images at the right.

This is still a work in progress: the flickr images aren't cached so I'm pinging flickr each time the home page loads. The old photo album plugin (FAlbum) is broken -- it just stopped working -- so I need to find all the references in our older posts and fix them. Plus I need to bring back the search and contact features, but at least the new face is up.

Because we no longer live in Newburyport, we changed the name back to just metrocat. The server changed names some time ago, now the site reflects that.
