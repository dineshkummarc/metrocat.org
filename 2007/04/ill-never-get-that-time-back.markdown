Last night we watched [Eragon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449010/). I wasn't expecting much from a story written by a teenager, but the movie started with backstory narration (never a good sign) and moved quickly on to wooden acting from [John Malkovich](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000518/) and the rest of the cast.

The story was crammed full of every clich&eacute; in the fantasy genre. Not one was left out. Despotic evil overlord: check. Wicked, nearly immortal sorcerer: check. Disgraced warrior becomes town drunk/trouble-maker, but has a heart of gold: check. Unknown youth becomes the salvation of the world: check.

The _only_ redeeming point in the whole movie was the depiction of the dragon. Unlike most fantasy movies, the dragon wasn't particularly reptilian. She was distinctly bird-like. While I don't have opinions one way or the other on dragons, this was a unique touch.

I have no idea how this movie rated almost 5 stars on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com).
