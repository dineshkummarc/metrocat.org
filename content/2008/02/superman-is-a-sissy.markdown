I'm a Spider-Man fan. I don't think it naturally follows that I wouldn't like Superman. I just don't. It's hard to take someone seriously when he's basically a minor god. So every time we walk past the Sharper Image store in Los Gatos with its enormous statue of Superman, I make it a point to tell Molly that Superman is a sissy.

Today, Anna tells me that as they walked past Sharper Image, Molly pointed at the Superman statue and said, "Superman is a sissy."

Did I mention that Molly loves the Spider-Man theme song?
