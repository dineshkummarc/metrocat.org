Well, Scruffy and I managed to survive a very wacky year. It wasn't altogether bad, just a little overwhelming at times.

Here are some married life stats that should help those who don't know (or don't recall):

* We have lived in three different states: New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts
* We have been out of the country twice: once to England for our honeymoon, and once to Cancun for a family reunion
* I have had three jobs; Jeff has had four
* I have nearly maintained my wedding weight; Jeff has lost nearly 30 more pounds!

2005 looks to be equally full of adventure, and with such a cute and energetic man by my side, a lot of fun as well! Stay tuned for updates as we have them!
