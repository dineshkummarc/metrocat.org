Yes, we're weird.

Most folks have their honeymoon at the same time they get hitched (well, technically, a couple of days later). But not us. No sirree.

We could have gone away in November to some sunny locale, where warm blue waters and lush green foliage awaited us and we lounged about on a pristine beach, drinking margaritas...

However, we decided instead to head off to the rolling countryside of England. In June.

It is difficult to wait until then, but obviously necessary. At least we have had some time to plan and save up some extra dollars to be lost in the currency conversion process.

We will be leaving on May 25th, flying on <a href="http://www.kuwait-airways.com/index3.html">Kuwait Airways</a> (Yes, I know- don't say it. The planes are new, and they were offering a significant promotion- $350 each roundtrip. So there.), and returning June 8th.

While in England, we will be hiking the <a href="http://www.cotswold.gov.uk/tourism/">Cotswolds</a>, and staying in the following places:

* [The Bell at Willersey][1]
* [Horse & Hound][2]
* An as-yet undisclosed location in London

Now, we just need to buy some rain gear!
