May this be a very exciting and successful year for us all! I hope that 2004 will bring changes in the areas of our lives that need 'em; stability in those that don't.

Yadda, yadda, yadda...

I hear the sounds of fireworks and helicopters- but as you can tell, I am typing away here on the couch. I couldn't be happier tonight than I am cuddling with my new hubby and our four furry children, not even with all of the obnoxious orange blinking hats and confetti in the world!

Perhaps I will share with you my resolutions later, but then again, maybe it will be more fun to keep them to myself...

If you really want me to share, just add a comment to this posting to tell me!
