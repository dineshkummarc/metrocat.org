Well folks, some of you have just lost some money, I imagine. Scruffy and I will celebrate our 2-month anniversary of wedded *cough* bliss this evening with a meal at our favorite restaurant. 

I must admit, with the snow and whatnot, it has been difficult to focus on the happy things happening for us recently. Hopefully a night like this will help us remember how fortunate we each are to have found someone (to put up with us)!

On a slightly different note, it would appear that my husband has been monopolizing this blog. I suppose I must do something about that.
