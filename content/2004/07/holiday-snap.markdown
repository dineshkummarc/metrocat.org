The law states that every visitor to London must have his (or her) photograph
taken either with one of the guards at the Palace or in front of the monument.
We opted for the monument one, because we didn’t feel like posing with some
guy with a bearskin covered waste paper basket on his head…

A charming young fella with a stuffed bear asked us to make a photograph of
him in front of the monument (with his video camera) and he was kind enough to
do the same for us. Of course, Anna was afraid he’d run off with our camera;
but she needn’t have worried.
