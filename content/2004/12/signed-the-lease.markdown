Well, I signed the lease for our new apartment this morning. So it's official.

I also dropped off our air mattress and my sleeping bag. <strong>No more hotels for me!</strong>

Of course, this also means that I'll not have a phone until Comcast can set up our combined cable internet and phone connection. Oddly enough, we won't be getting any cable television service from them...
