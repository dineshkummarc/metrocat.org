Sheep rule the English countryside. Really. Although you’ll find cows and
horses, sheep seem to be the dominant form of life in the Cotswolds. Of
course, this makes sense considering that the Cotswolds were the center of the
English wool industry. But still.

Just consider, where there are sheep there’s sheep shit.
