Situated in Broad Campden (just outside Chipping Campden), this alley is
actually along a public footpath. On the left is the entrance to another
quaint Cotswold cottage. Obviously the owner takes pride in his (or her) home.

This is a far cry from the alleyways of my acquaintance here in the US: there
was no smell of stale urine or discarded fast food wrappers.

Of course, on the right is my sweety wearing her stinky fleece.
