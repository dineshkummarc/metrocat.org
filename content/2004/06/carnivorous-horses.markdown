These horses had earlier devoured another walker otherwise we wouldn’t have
been able to walk through their paddock unmolested. Later, we received reports
that other walkers had spotted them sharpening their fangs.

Strangely, Anna doesn’t believe in Carnivorous Horses.

Although not nearly as numerous as sheep, horses are another Cotswold
favourite. We frequently heard “clop, clop, clop, clop” only to turn around
and spot a horse (with rider) walking along the road. Because there were
witnesses present, the horses behaved themselves and didn’t display their
glistening fangs.
