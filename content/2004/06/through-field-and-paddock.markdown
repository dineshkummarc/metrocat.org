The whole concept of a public right-of-way seems to boggle the mind of most
Americans. Although this would never work in the US, public footpaths and
bridle-ways work remarkably well in England. Walkers tend to be very
respectful of the land ownerâ€™s wishes and usually keep to the path.

This photograph is from a section of the Cotswold Way between Chipping Campden
and the Broadway Tower. We really liked the way the path snakes off through
this field into the trees in the distance.
