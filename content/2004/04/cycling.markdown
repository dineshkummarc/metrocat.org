Okay, so I went bicycling today. I borrowed Anna's bike and followed one of the Rhinebeck & Red Hook Historic District's bike paths. 10 miles later, I'm a little beat.

The worst part is that Anna's bike doesn't seem to be able to down shift into gears 1 through 7. That makes climbing some of the hills around here quite a challenge. I never got off the bike (except to answer several phone calls); but I certainly wish I had.

More on this later...
