Well, sorta. This morning after being awakened _very_ early by the cats and while I was waiting for my morning cup of tea to steep, I happened to be petting Madeline and looking out our kitchen window when **boink** a bluebird landed on the branch just feet from my nose. Moments later a second bluebird landed next to him. Of course, Madeline was going ape. _Two birds were taunting her!_

This highlights one of the differences between living in Rhinebeck and Jersey City. As I recall, there were lots of birds in Jersey City: pigeons, seagulls, and other aerial rodents. But this is somehow better.

**Update:** my grasp of ornithology is severely limited. That explains why I mistook a blue jay for a bluebird. It seems they are two entirely different types of birds. Who knew?
