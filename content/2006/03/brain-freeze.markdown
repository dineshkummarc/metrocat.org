As part of my post-operative care, I've been irrigating my sinuses with salt water. The instructions pretty clearly state that I should use warm or room-temperature water.

This morning I made some more "nose water" with the filtered water from the fridge. In went 3 tsp of salt (iodised instead of kosher, sorry) and a tsp of baking soda, which for some reason known only to her and her cadre of winged monkeys, my wife keeps in the bathroom. And up my nose went the "nose water".

Now I understand why they recommend using **warm** water: my brain is still frozen.
