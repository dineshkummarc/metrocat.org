Okay, so perhaps I exaggerate a wee bit. But as of this writing, the Molly of today is much like the Molly of last month. One moment, she is quiet, curious, with the sparkle of intelligence in her dark eyes.

The next moment, often without warning, she deafens us with her crying and shrieking. Not even earplugs help defend us.

But this month, Molly has added something new to the mix- smiles:

Little smiles, big smiles, and lopsided grins. She smiled at her mommy first, and then after much anxiety on his part, smiled at her daddy as well. Her chubby, chubby cheeks are adorable!

In other news, Molly's visit to the pediatrician went well. She has gone from being a 7lb 9.5oz weakling to a 12lb 1oz butterball (75th-90th percentile)! She has also grown 3 inches in length to 23 inches (75th percentile).

She was a brave little girl when she got her shots- very little crying. Now, if only we could discover what causes her outbursts at home...
