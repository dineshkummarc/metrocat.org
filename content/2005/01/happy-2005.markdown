I have decided to try a different format for my resolutions this year, although in reality it will probably end up as the same laundry list of things I would like to accomplish and/or modify.

Here goes:

> I resolve to better myself, both as an individual and as an aspiring mother, through the development of aspects of my mind, body, and spirit. It is my overall goal that through these personal achievements, I am able to make a significant and meaningful contribution to the world at large. 

I also hope that by breaking the resolution into 3 categories (with approximately 5-10 resolutions each) that I will be better able to express and organize my goals, and therefore maybe accomplish more in 2005.

Stay tuned for the actual list of "mini-resolutions"- coming to a blog near you!
