We popped up to Acadia National Park to celebrate my birthday (a week late).
There’s a wonderful little trail along the waterfront in Bar Harbor, and as
Anna’s really starting to show how pregnant she is, she’s all about the easy
flat trails.

As you’ll see in other photos, she’s no sissy. We climbed Penobscott mountain
at 1196 ft the next day.
