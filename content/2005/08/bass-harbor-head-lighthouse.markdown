Iâ€™ve always been a fan of lighthouses. Especially when then stand in remote
parts of the world as the sole outpost of civilisation. Well, Bass Harbor Head
Lighthouse does **not** represent a sole outpost of civilisation, but with
careful framing, it certainly looks that way.

Just out of the frame were dozens of people scrambling around on the rocks.
All being bitten by mosquitos.
