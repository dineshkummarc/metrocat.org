We'll be heading to Acadia National Park in a couple days. Anna has insisted on going camping. I told her I'd be willing to spring for a plush room at a B&B, but she wouldn't hear of it. If you ask me, she's going a little overboard with this whole camping thing.

It will be my second visit to Acadia and Anna's first. We'll be certain to take some photographs and fill you in on all the details.

Of course, it will be good fun watching Preggo walking along the carriage trails in the park.
