I have been told I have strange dreams. Whatever that means. Jeff has suggested I amuse all two or three of you by posting them here. 

I know I had a dream last night, but of course I have forgotten it already. So, I will share the previous night's entry (or what I can remember), and the books that probably influenced them:

> "I was in a very large, crumbling Victorian house. Suddenly, there were [flesh-eating zombies][1] everywhere! Never fear, I had a solution- a [cleaning solution][2], that is. Now, if I could only remember the [right formula][3]..." 

Sometimes thoughts appear at random, and sometimes my insanity is inspired (by the strangest things). Tune in tomorrow for more from _Anna's Head Presents_!
