Just when I thought we had SPAM licked, the spamming bastards start using track-back pings to ruin our Web site. I've spent most of the morning deleting track-back pings and configuring our templates to prevent any further abuse. I've also completely removed the ability for this installation of [Movable Type][1] to accept incoming track-back pings.

I know that's a pretty brute-force solution, but I'm not really clever enough to work out a better one. Maybe when I finally upgrade to MT 3.15 (or whatever) I'll install the blacklist plug-in to help prevent SPAM...
