We're going on Summer Vacation with my high-school buddy, [Bradley](http://faculty.wiu.edu/CB-Dilger/), and his wife, [Erin](http://homepage.macomb.com/~erine/). The goal is to do some hiking and explore the Green or White mountains just north of us. Of course, this plan may be *slightly* affected by our desire to get Anna knocked up.

[Hiking: Inn to Inn](http://www.inntoinn.com/self_hike.htm) -- The Long Trail or Hiking Gourmet options, although expensive, sound cool. One of the inns, Judith's Garden, was on Erin's original list of things to do in VT.

[Hut to Hut along the AT](http://gorp.away.com/gorp/location/nh/hik_hut.htm) -- [The Appalachian Mountain Club](http://www.outdoors.org/), which we joined only the other day, maintains [eight huts along the Appalachian Trail in New Hampshire's White Mountains](http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/huts/index.cfm). Each hut is a day's hike apart -- covering a total distance of 56 miles. *This sounds incredibly cool.* They provide food and lodging leaving us to worry about packing water, clothes and minor other gear. We could easily stash a car at one end of the trail before the trip, and hike all the way across. **Reservations are available.** We should probably jump on this quickly if we're interested. Of course, Anna points out that if she's pregnant, some of the hikes might be too strenuous.

[Inns and B&Bs in VT](http://www.a1trails.com/lodging/ldgvt.html) -- There are tons of Inns and B&Bs in VT. We could probably plan our own "slackpacking" itinerary. However, the folks at [WonderWalks](http://www.wonderwalks.com/tours.htm) offer lots of cool, if expensive, Inn-to-Inn walks. I doubt if we could actually afford any of these. But they certainly sound cool.

All of this is from a very brief google of \`Net resources. I'll check into back issues of Outside magazine and see what I can dig up.
