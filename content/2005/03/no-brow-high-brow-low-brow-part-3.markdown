##LOW BROW##
A little appetizer before the meat of this story…

Jeff recently went shopping for jeans here in Newburyport. Given the upscale
nature of many of the shops here, I told him it may be difficult for him to
find them at all. I suggested [No Sweat Apparel][1], based in Massachusetts
that sells union-made attire. However, Jeff thought that a business from the
same state still wasn't local enough to support, and off we went.

We found a very nice men's clothing store nearby, and the clerk happily led us
to the jeans section, where he helped Jeff pick out a couple of pairs to try
on. While Jeff was in the changing room, he searched the shelves for special
jeans made from a new material (recycled wood pulp) called [Tencel][2]. He was
very disappointed when he could not find any. I was oddly suspicious that as
cool as they sounded, his enthusiasm was driven more by the expensive of the
item than its practicality.

He wandered off, leaving me to listen to the conversations of the other store
patrons. A young woman had entered with her father. She needed an item
altered. Apparently her father had had his golf pants altered at the same
shop, and blah, blah, blah.

When the conversation turned to yachting, I redirected my attention to
searching the store for those exciting Tencel jeans. I happened to glance at a
few price tags and realized that one could purchase jeans in the shop for
prices from a mere $60 to over $100. _For one pair of jeans_. I suddenly felt
as if I had recently crawled out from under a rock, and seen the "real" world.

Right on cue, our friendly clerk came back over to check on us. Jeff was
_still_ in the dressing room.

The clerk saw me glancing at other pairs of jeans, and very helpfully shared
the following information- and I quote, “**These** jeans (gesturing to a less
expensive pair) are very popular with the _workers_, while **these** are more
popular with _Newburyporters_.”

It was soon after that Jeff emerged from the dressing room, and we both
decided that we would show solidarity with our fellow workers, and shop
elsewhere.

Now, for the main course…

Last night we saw some of the "non-workers" of Newburyport while out on the
town. In order to avoid some of the madness that is St. Patrick's Day in a
very Irish town filled with lots of pubs, we decided to see [Second City
Comedy Troupe][3] at [The Firehouse Center for the Arts][4], quite literally,
right next door to our apartment.

The crowd looked like [The Stepford Wives (1975)][5], if everyone had a New
England accent and ate a lot more granola. They all seemed friendly and
harmless enough. But if you have ever seen a larger number of Newburyporters
gathered in one room, and have ever lived in a larger city, you will notice
one thing (and not just the man in the lavender cordoroy pants)- everyone is
really, really _white_.

Second City was incredibly funny, and as we are fortunate enough to live in a
"Blue State", some of the biggest laughs of the evening came at the expense of
ultra-religious conservatives. I was most impressed that the humor, while
occasionally off-color, was not crude. I would love to see more of America
able to use their brains in order to get a joke now and again, even if those
jokes were sometimes at their own expense.
