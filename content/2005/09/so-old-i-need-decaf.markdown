Anna and I just got back from the coffee shop at the top of Inn St. We've been there a number of times -- they make a mean hot chocolate that Anna just loves.

Most of the time when we go there, I get a hot tea. In fact, last time I was there, I joked with the young lady behind the counter that I definitely wanted caffeinated tea rather than decaffeinated. However, I must be looking old tonight, because she gave me a decaf tea.

Perhaps she figured it was approaching my bed time (true) and I didn't need the caffein to keep me awake all night.

I just wish my bones didn't creak when I got up in the morning...
