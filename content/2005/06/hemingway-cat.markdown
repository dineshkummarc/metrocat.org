The end of April found us in Key West. One of the must see sights is the
Hemingway House. Not so much because Iâ€™m a big fan of Hemingway, but because
of the Cats.

This particular cat reminds me very strongly of my buddy Spunk. Sadly, Spunk
is no longer with us, but this fella had his markings, moves and attitude down
pat.
