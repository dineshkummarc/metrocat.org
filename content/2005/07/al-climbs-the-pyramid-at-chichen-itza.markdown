The Watkins clan assembled in Cancun last October. One of the numerous
excursions was a trip to the Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza. And who can go to
Chichen Itza without climbing the pyramid. I made Anna climb it — she’s
already forgiven me, well, mostly — and I captured Al during his ascent.

If you think it looks steep, it’s steeper than you think…
