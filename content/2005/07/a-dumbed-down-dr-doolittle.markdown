Everything I've read and heard about early childhood indicates that there is a
certain amount of frustration that exists for both parents and children with
regard to communication. A parent is frustrated because a small child is
unable to speak, and therefore it is initially nearly impossible to determine
what he/she wants except through trial and error. A child is frustrated that
parents are such dolts that they can't see the child's obvious needs.

Well, here in the Watkins (Northeast Branch) household, we may not yet have a
little baby from which to learn, but our fur-children are only to happy to
teach us a lesson in communication. Augustus in particular.

Jeff had written earlier ([here][1] and [here][2]) about his buddy Augustus'
particularly annoying habit of "singing" to us all night long. He had even
seemed to figure out a possible [cause][3].

Well, many people have spoken about the difference between _hearing_ and
_listening_. We certainly had heard enough of Augustus' crying, but it took a
while to really process what he was saying. Fortunately for Augustus (and
somewhat unfortunately for us), he is one persistent feline.

Now that Magic and Tim are _finally_ on a real diet (and both very unhappy
about it, let me tell you), Augustus and Madeline's food is well protected. A
little too well protected. As soon as they appear to be done with their food,
we take it away, and out of the reach of Magic's eager jaws.

Augustus still cries in the middle of the night, but Jeff leaps (this is of
course a relative term) into action and feeds him right away, standing guard
to make certain Magic doesn't bully his way into the bowl.

Madeline also gets hungry (and never at the same time as Augustus). Her
approach is more subtle, but equally effective. She licks Jeff's nose and
upper lips until he shuffles to the kitchen to feed her.

All in all, I think Jeff and I (the cats indirectly wake me up too) get
between 4-6 hours of sleep. Yawn.

Bring on the kid, the cats have already trained us!
