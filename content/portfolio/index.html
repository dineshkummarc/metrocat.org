    <h2>Open Source Projects</h2>
    <p>Although these days I don't have as much free time as I'd like, I still
    try to release some of my code as Open Source. These are tools and library
    code that have enabled me to build incredibly feature rich applications in
    very little time.</p>
    
    <h3>Coherent</h3>
    <p>I developed an implementation of Apple's Cocoa Key Value Coding,
    Observing &amp; Binding technology and a MVC library based on the Cocoa UI
    library. Although originally developed as an Open Source project, in the
    Summer of 2008 I sold this library to Apple and it is now available as part
    of the Dashcode Web development tool included with Mac OS X 10.6, Snow
    Leopard.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the license for the source code generated by Dashcode is
    incredibly generous and I was able to reconstitute Coherent and make some
    much needed bug fixes and improvements.</p>
    
    <p>A beta version of the <a href="http://github.com/jeffwatkins/coherent">Coherent library version 3.0</a>
    is now available via GitHub. This version includes speed improvements (up to
    2&times; faster core operations), significantly more flexible support for
    animation, and many other new features.</p>
    
    <p>As time allows, I'm writing a series of introductory lessons for developing
    a simple application that browses visitor's Flickr photo collection. You can
    read <a href="http://jeffwatkins.github.com/coherent/howto/browsr/">Part 1:
    Creating a Simple Flickr Photo Browser</a>.

    <h3>Distil</h3>
    <p>Working with Tobie Langel, one of the core developers on the Prototype
    Javascript library, I recently released a build tool for optimising Javascript
    and CSS assets. This is something of a passion for me, because it can make such
    a dramatic difference in the performance of a Web site or application.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to get Distil is by installing the Ruby Gem: <code>gem install distil</code>.
    The source for Distil is available at <a href="http://github.com/jeffwatkins/distil">http://github.com/jeffwatkins/distil</a>.</p>

    <h2>Evri.com</h2>
    
    <p>My work at Evri is just beginning to bear fruit. Since I joined in May, 2010,
    I've led the effort to consolidate and rationalise our static assets, streamline
    our legacy server interactions, and enrich our Web site with interactions to
    engage and enable our readers.</p>
    
    <div class="movie">
        <a href="evri-curation-480.mov" rel="qtposter">
        	<img class="poster" src="evri-curation-480.png" width="640" height="480" />
        </a>
    </div>
    
    <p>We're currently hard at work building our first iPad application. Building on
    the strengths of my team, we've chosen an HTML5-based hybrid application. In
    part this decision was motivated by a desire to bring many of the lessons
    learned in this project back to our Web site thus elevating it to a genuinely
    rich exploratory tool rather than merely a news reading site.</p>  
    
    <h2>Apple Online Store</h2>
    
    <p>I was hired at the Apple Online Store in March, 2007, as a Sr. UI Engineer
    and was promoted one year later to manage the team, however the internal
    politics and the constant pressure of being responsible for a multi-billion
    dollar e-commerce site was a bit much for me &mdash; I hardly got to see my family
    and the stress began to affect my health. I stepped down from this position
    at the beginning of 2009 and returned my focus to working on the
    architecture and framework library.</p>
    
    <h3>Product Details Gallery</h3>
    <p>The first movie is Apple's Product Details Gallery. This was one of the
    first major features to use the JavaScript library I invented and donated to
    Apple (I started work on this library back in 2005, before I joined Apple).
    This library presently weighs in at ~18k lines of code and 38Kb after
    minification and gzipping. One of the things you'll notice in this demo is
    the smooth animation between modes for the gallery. The optimisation
    techniques used here were the subject of part of my talk at Apple's World
    Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) last year.</p>
    
    <div class="movie">
        <a href="product-details-gallery-480.mov" rel="qtposter">
        	<img class="poster" src="product-details-gallery.png" width="640" height="480" />
        </a>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Hero Product Gallery</h3>
    <p>Next is the Hero Product Gallery. I built this component shortly after
    joining Apple, and to my eye, it's a bit clunkier than some of the newer
    components. This component was built before I'd begun to steer the Store in
    the direction of using Javascript in a more active role, and as a result,
    it requires quite a bit of mark up in order to do its thing. On the other
    hand, it looks OK even when Javascript is disabled.</p>

    <div class="movie">
        <a href="step1-gallery-480.mov" rel="qtposter">
        	<img class="poster" src="step1-gallery.png" width="640" height="480" />
        </a>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Engraving Gallery</h3>
    <p>As the manager of the Front End team, I did the initial prototype and
    exploratory coding for the iPod Engraving Gallery, because the rest of the
    team was swamped getting the Store ready for the holidays. This feature
    required a number of enhancements to our Javascript framework, but I managed
    to keep the bloat down to a minimum. Those enhancements were later used with
    the roll-out of iLife 09 to display movies in an overlay rather than a
    separate window.</p>

    <div class="movie">
        <a href="engraving-gallery-480.mov" rel="qtposter">
        	<img class="poster" src="engraving-gallery.png" width="640" height="480" />
        </a>
    </div>

    <h3>iLife '09: GarageBand Lesson Store</h3>
    <p>As part of a small, super-secret team, I developed the initial prototype
    and primary Javascript code for the GarageBand Lesson Store. This was the
    first time I'd been able to fully take advantage of HTML5 and CSS
    Animations, because the target environment was a Webkit browser embedded in 
    the GarageBand application. The enhancements to support the HTML5 VIDEO tag
    were also critical to the Dashcode product release.</p>
    <p>This was also the first time the Apple Online Store had deployed a single-page
    Web application. All data was fetched immediately after page load, and the
    Javascript built the entire UI.</p>

    <div class="movie">
        <a href="GarageBand-lesson-store-480.mov" rel="qtposter">
        	<img class="poster" src="GarageBand-lesson-store.png" width="640" height="480" />
        </a>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Flickr Photo Gallery</h3>
    <p>The final movie is the Flickr Photo Gallery from my proposed talk for WWDC
    '09. With the Snow Leopard release of Mac OS X, my Javascript library became
    the framework powering applications generated using <a
    href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/dashcode/">Dashcode</a>. As part of
    the proposal for a talk on developing components for use with Dashcode, I
    developed a demo that allowed browsing a Flickr photo repository.</p>

    <div class="movie">
        <a href="flickr-gallery-demo-480.mov" rel="qtposter">
        	<img class="poster" src="flickr-gallery-demo.png" width="640" height="480" />
        </a>
    </div>

    <h2>Sentillion</h2>
    <p>Before joining Apple, I had the opportunity to be the User Interface Architect
    for a small company building automation tools for the healthcare IT industry.
    My project was a series of application generation tools enabling IT developers
    to build automated scripts for managing single sign-on and account provisioning
    for legacy applications.</p>

    <div class="movie">
        <a href="bridgebuilder-for-provisioning.pdf">
        	<img class="poster" src="bridgebuilder-for-provisioning.png" width="640" height="480" />
        </a>
    </div>

    <p>The final project I worked on, BridgeBuilder for Provisioning, was never
    released. It was our most ambitious attempt to unify our tools for generating
    automated scripts that could target both Windows native and Web applications.</p>
