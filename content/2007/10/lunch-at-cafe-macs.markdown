One of the great things about Anna now having a car is that we can get together for lunch. Granted, Cafe Macs isn't exactly gourmet dining, but Molly doesn't seem to mind.

However, I really need to purchase an iPhone for Anna so that she can get her own directions rather than constantly bogarting mine...
