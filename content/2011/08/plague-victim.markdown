Poor Molly brought back some sort of plague from the wilds of Seattle. Yesterday, she woke around 7:30 (about an hour later than usual) and declared she was still tired. After drinking some juice and visiting the bathroom, she went back to bed and slept until almost 10. When she finally woke, she complained of a headache; we found she was running a temperature of 101°F. Worrisome, but not an emergency. So we rested about the house most of the day.

This morning, Molly woke me around 6am to let me know she had a headache again. I gave her an Advil and some Benedryl before checking her temperature: 102.5°F. Worrisome enough to pay a visit to the Urgent Care clinic up in Mountain View. No strep throat, thank goodness. But she won't be able to go to school tomorrow.

I wish there were something I could do, but at least she's sleeping now.
