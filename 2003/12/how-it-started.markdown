Anna would like to claim everything is my fault; but now, I have the proof that she started it. Of course, if she had only been willing to move to Seattle, we probably would have been married years ago.

I have been fortunate enough to work for a time as a screenwriter's assistant (to a man who wrote for "The Simpsons"), but for the most part, I have been working in that damn video store again, and plotting my escape from Kingston. I have also worked as a software/website tester, and am currently employed part-time as a ground assistant for a tree removal service.
