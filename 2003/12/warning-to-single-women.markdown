...don't get married if you live in Jersey City!

Well, perhaps I'm being a little overly dramatic. It has happened before (or so I've been told) and it will most likely happen again.

Maybe I'm just overreacting because I am tired- the past five days have been a whirlwind of wedding activity (including both pre- and post-wedding activity with our families), but very little sleep. Or maybe it was something I (over-)ate.

And I don't much care for standing in line. So I'm certain that probably contributed to my annoyance.

However, the point really is that, in order to become Mrs. Watkins, I had to spend an entire day running hither and yon, from one office to the next.

Not bad you say?

Imagine spending FOUR HOURS in lines at the NJ Motor Vehicle Office/Commission/Hell and Social Security Administration. Two of those hours, I might add, were spent standing in line at Social Security. The punchline of the latter experience was that while I may have stood in line for two hours, it actually took about two minutes for the woman behind the glass to process my application.

I did meet a very interesting white guy with dreadlocks formerly from Queens, who was standing in line for his 8-month pregnant wife and 4 year old daughter formerly from Japan, but the diversion did not allow me to completely forget that I was participating in the most horrific and misguided experiment since the Spanish Inquisition.

Oh, how I pray that someday my new hubby and I will find ourselves in a land where the DMV lines are short, and if not, then at least the comfy chairs are plentiful!

In the meantime, I am happy to say that I may now truly call myself Anna Mary Watkins, and flash the ID to prove it!

More on the wedding soon- probably this weekend I have a moment to tinker on my new laptop, Zoe, the spiffy 12-inch powerbook!
