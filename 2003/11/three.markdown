So, here we are, on day number 3 before our wedding!

Leaving work today, I felt like a kid leaving the last class before summer vacation, although I have a mere five days of frantic freedom before returning to the reception desk.

Speaking of work, my co-workers surprised me with cake, cards, and a very generous gift. I was completely overwhelmed by the sweetness of the gesture (and the cake), and was too embarrassed to say more than "thank you", but I truly appreciated their kind words. Heck, I'm just a temp, but they treated me more decently than many of the places for which I had worked "permanently"!

This evening, my future in-laws arrived, and we gathered for dinner. God, I hate the term "in-law"! They are such a great group- well worth joining (a bonus on top of being able to marry their fantastic son) for conversation and for making one feel at home.

Everyone continues to ask me if I feel excited or nervous. As the hour of our union approaches, I just feel lucky.
