Maybe you've not noticed, but the URL for this Web site has changed to [newburyportion.com](http://newburyportion.com).

We finally had it with the [lame ass, losers over at HostExcellence](http://www.hostexcellence.com/) and moved up to [TextDrive](http://textdrive.com). Part of the reason for the move is that I'll be able to run [TurboGears](http://www.turbogears.org/) on the TextDrive server **and** I get ssh access to the TextDrive server. And of course, it doesn't suck.

Sadly it costs more, but then I suspect we'll get what we pay for: servers that don't crash constantly (4 out of 5 times I try to save an article I got a server error with HostExcellence) and *much* better customer service.

Plus our domain name now makes sense...
