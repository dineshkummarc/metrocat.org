This morning I heard [Diana Krall singing Temptation](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=6737791&s=143441&i=6737767), a Tom Waits song from [Frank's Wild Years](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?s=143441&playlistId=83999). I've said it before and I'll say it again now, sooner or later everyone who's any good will cover a Tom Waits song.

It turns out I actually own both albums. That's even more brilliant.
