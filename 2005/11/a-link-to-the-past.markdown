The other day, Anna pointed out that my favourite radio station, [KPLU](http://kplu.org), now has a audio stream that is compatible with iTunes.

I remember complaining about this the last time I donated to KPLU, back in 2001 or so. And I'm really, really glad they've decided to support iTunes.

Now this makes it imperative that I purchase a new [SqueezeBox](http://slimdevices.com/) and some [Edirol speakers](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=productlist&A=details&Q=&sku=381548&is=REG&addedTroughType=search). Anyone have a spare $400?
