In the weeks ahead (I'd say days if I weren't so busy/lazy), I'll be
integrating my technology Weblog, [nerd.newburyportion][1], back into the main
Web site. It will still be focused on technology/programming issues, but it
will feel like a _part_ of the overall newburyportion Web site. This means
stylistic changes to unify them -- although I still like the charcoal and
"piss yellow" (as [my buddy Josh][2] called it).

Anna also wants her own Web site, which will be integrated here, but be
stylistically all her own. (Hint, hint, you lazy devil: the sooner you draw up
the design, the sooner I can code it.)

Work, work, workâ€¦
