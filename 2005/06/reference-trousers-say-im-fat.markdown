This time last year, I bought my first pair of size 32 jeans in over a decade. And what's so amazing, is they fit. Not snug, even after washing.

This morning, I put on a freshly laundered pair of size 32 jeans and they are *really snug*.

With a Preggo constantly eating, it's hard to stay on my diet.
