For once, as a pedestrian, I felt perfectly safe. The road in question is
buried under five to six feet of snow. Of course, walking along the _road_ was
a trifle difficult as our feet kept plunging down into the snow.

This sign struck me as particularly funny given how difficult it would be for
a car or truck to have driven a quarter of a mile down the snow-obscured road
to this parking lot.
