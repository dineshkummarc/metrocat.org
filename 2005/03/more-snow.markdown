Gods damn! Last night we received another gift of snow from [Ullr, Norse God of Snow][ullr]: 4-6 inches of nasty white crap, which had to be shovelled away from our cars. Of course, it was still snowing when we were done, and we had about another inch or two of the foul precipitation when I checked around dinner time.

Will the torment never end?
