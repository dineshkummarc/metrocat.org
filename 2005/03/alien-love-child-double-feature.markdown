**Period due, but no period arrives.**

Dream 1:

An alien has been implanted in me, and proceeds to download all of the information stored in my brain, especially language info. My eyes roll back in my head as this happens rapidly.

Dream 2:

I am [Sandra Bullock][1] transporting test tubes filled with alien DNA (2 different kinds) in a plane/helicopter. The aircraft malfunctions, and I am forced to bail, climbing down a net. In the process, one of the test tubes in damaged, and the species of alien to which it belongs has come to Earth to kick our butts. 

In the meantime, I combine the contents of the test tubes (One blue and the other red) to create a new alien species. This ends the threat to us and creates a truce between the two warring alien species.
