**2 days before period due.**

I tested again in the morning, before I went to the Dr.'s office for my yearly physical. BFN (Big Fat Negative) again. I was disappointed, but needed to double check in case there was any news to share with the Doc.

This was a general physical, and showed I was in very good health. I asked the doctor about keeping track of my cycle in the hopes of increasing our chance of conceiving. She told me that we should just have fun, and if we didn't have any luck in a year, then we would talk about what to do next. I thought that perhaps a year was too long, but didn't say anything.

As the physical did not include a thorough checkup of the, um, "undercarriage" so to speak, the doctor suggested I schedule a follow-up visit in about a month. She told me to contact her if we were able to conceive before then, and she would advise me accordingly. Did she know something I didn't know, or was she just being cautious? Perhaps I was reading too much into it...

The visit ended with a ever-so-lovely (and somewhat painful) tetanus booster. Doctors always know how to show you a good time.
