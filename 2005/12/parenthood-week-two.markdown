Here are five additional things I have learned since the birth of little Miss Molly:

1. "Colic" is not something that only happens to other people's babies.

2. Sleep IS something that happens to other people.

3. Little babies can quite literally grow before your eyes.

4. You can adapt to/be non-chalant about getting #1 and #2 all over your fingers whilst changing a diaper. Same applies to spit-up on your brand new sweatshirt.

5. There is nothing more amazing than little fingers clutched tightly around yours.
