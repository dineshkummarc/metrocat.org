On Saturday, 5 February, the temperature topped 50Â°F. So we went for a walk
along Plum Island. It was _so_ warm, in fact, that I decided to take off my
boots and walk barefoot along the beach.

We walked a total of 9 miles, half on the beach and half along the road that
winds through the salt marsh. Absolutely beautiful.
