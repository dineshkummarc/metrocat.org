I'm accustomed to making broad statements without qualification (hey, I was in Sales for a while). But the other day, I was reading the Web site of a somewhat popular Javascript library written by a PhD, and after nearly every article on the site, I had to shake my head and ask, "Is this what they're teaching kids in Computer Science today?"

Just one of the things that made me shake my head: *"The primary mechanism by which most modern OOP languages (such as Java and C#) implement this [Multiple Inheritance] is through the use of interfaces."*

Bzzzt! Wrong. And you've got a PhD? In What?

### The danger of experts ###

Now I don't really have a problem with some kid standing up on his virtual soap box and making a fool of himself before the ink is even dry on his precious PhD sheepskin. What I really have a problem with is the general calibre of developer using Javascript is such that this sort of mistake will be accepted as gospel.

How do I know? Well I didn't stumble across this Web site out of thin air. I encountered it via links from several Web development sites and also coincidentally on del.icio.us. Those Web developers linking to this site were ecstatic that someone was mimicking the .Net library (questionable idea) and were terribly impressed with the doctor's efforts.

What's worse, is some of the code is quite good. I'd question the need for quite a lot of it, but that's just because I'm very comfortable with Javascript and don't need an extensive library like this.

### I'm no expert ###

If you ever catch me claiming to be an expert at anything, call bullshit. I've written a lot of software over the years for numerous platforms with a variety of languages and libraries. That gives me perspective.

And I'm naturally opinionated. (Ask anyone who knows me well.)

Of course, I have a way of stating things that would enable you to *think* I'm an expert: I don't go in for self doubt in the realm of software design. But I frequently change my mind when someone questions my ideas, because it's just code.

### Providing an alternative voice ###

I once worked for a guy who classified software developers into two groups: those that *got it* and those that didn't. Of course, *getting it* was solely defined by him. But I like that description. Each of us finds somethings come naturally. For some of my colleagues, developing complex algorithms comes easily. For me, my brain overheats and melts down if I have to think up anything more complicated than a basic sort algorithm.

But I feel obliged to provide an alternative to "expert advice" which I consider plain wrong. Maybe I'll succeed. Maybe I won't.

But at least there's a comment box on the bottom of each page where you can point out my (many) mistakes.
