As the release of Coherent looms nearer, I've been encouraged to start writing some documentation. My first effort is up: [Writing a Widget](/2008/02/writing-a-widget). This tutorial takes you through creating a widget using Coherent starting with raw mark up and ending with a functional (if simple) widget. Thanks to some great feedback (and encouragement) from [Neil Mix](http://neilmix.com) of [Pandora](http://pandora.com), this tutorial doesn't suck.

Oh, and if you haven't tried Pandora yet, what the heck are you waiting for? This is one of the coolest things I've run across in ages. Of course, now my wallet is going to be completely empty because I've been turned onto a half dozen musicians I'd never heard of before...
