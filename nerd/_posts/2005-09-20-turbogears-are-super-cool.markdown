I've been exploring [TurboGears](http://www.turbogears.org) since Saturday when I first ran across it.

It's amazing just how quick it is to create a small Web application. I haven't yet expanded my scope beyond small samples, but I can easily see how this framework (or [mega-framework as it's being called by others](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7835)) will be invaluable for a project I'm working on.

It's great to be excited about developing a Web application again.
