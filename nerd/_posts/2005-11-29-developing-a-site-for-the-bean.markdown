Some of you may already know that in about a week's time I will become a father for the first time. My wife has already registered the domain name weewatkins.com so I'd like to create a Web site for her to post photos and short thoughts.

Does anyone have any suggestions of sites I can look at for inspiration. It should be obvious if you've seen the last few incarnations of [newburyportion](http://newburyportion.com) and this site that I'm no great graphic artist. Worse, I don't know any good graphic artists well enough to impose on them for help.

So simple would be good. But any inspirational sites would be a good start.
