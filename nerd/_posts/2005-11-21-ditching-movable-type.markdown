I need a better content management system than [Movable Type](http://sixapart.com/movabletype/). I've written about this before ([Movable Type Feels Stagnant](http://newburyportion.com/nerd/2005/11/movable-type-feels-stagnant) and [What's Wrong With Movable Type](http://newburyportion.com/nerd/2005/09/whats-wrong-with-movable-type)).

I downloaded a copy of [TextPattern](http://textpattern.com/) (developed by the guys from [TextDrive](http://textdrive.com/) -- my hosting company. But TextPattern doesn't seem to be able to handle the permanent URLs I've been using in Movable Type. I suspect this could be overcome, but [MarsEdit](http://ranchero.com/marsedit/) doesn't recognise TextPattern. Finally, TextPattern doesn't support [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

That clinches it. No TextPattern for me.

I'm certain [Josh](http://bokardo.com/) would love me to use [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). [WordPress supports MarkDown](http://www.michelf.com/weblog/2005/wordpress-text-flow-vs-markdown/) (albeit the text flowing algorithms have made this particularly difficult. However, the procedure for [importing Movable Type entries to WordPress](http://wordpress.org/docs/tutorials/import-mt/) is over a dozen steps and has only been tested with an ancient version of MT and a similarly ancient version of WordPress.

On the positive side, MarsEdit supports WordPress. So maybe I'll give it a try.

If anyone has any recent experience converting from Movable Type to WordPress, I'd love to hear about it.
