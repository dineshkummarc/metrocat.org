OK. Now I get it. The whole Bundles thing hasn't got really good usability, but it certainly is powerful.

I'm also [doing a fail bit of Python development](http://metrocat.org/nerd/2005/10/identity-management-for-turbogears) these days. TextWrangler just doesn't handle expanding tabs into spaces correctly, and because indentation is significant to Python, this can be a huge problem.

Now all I need do is figure out how to buy it.
