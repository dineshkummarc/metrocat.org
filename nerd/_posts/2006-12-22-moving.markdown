Things have been very quiet here lately. I know I originally said I'd be posting frequently about this cool application I've been developing, but something else came up... [we've decided to move to Seattle](http://newburyportion.com/2006/12/upcoming-changes).





Well, back to Seattle in my case. I first moved to Seattle in the summer of 1995 after spending a month there on vacation. I didn't leave until the summer of 2002 after shattering my knee in the North Cascades on the eve of my 30th birthday the summer before.

So, as you can imagine, I haven't accomplished much work on the Mac application I've been working on. But I also haven't abandoned it. The more I talk about the features with friends, the more convinced I am that I've got a winner on my hands: I just need to wrap some code around the ideas and get it out there.

Everything should be ironed out by the second week in January. And I hope to get back to posting about my experience _learning_ Cocoa.
