I've long been [dissatisfied with Movable Type](http://newburyportion.com/nerd/2005/09/whats-wrong-with-movable-type). But more and more it feels like Movable Type has ground to a standstill. Yes, the folks at [SixApart](http://www.sixapart.com/) recently released version 3.2 which has lots of enhancements and improvements. Yes, there is *still* a reasonably thriving community of Movable Typers.

But one of the much-hyped features of the 3.x release was the ability to publish dynamically using PHP. Excellent. But where are the plug-ins for the PHP dynamic publishing?

My buddy Josh is constantly experimenting with little plug-ins for WordPress. Granted, one of them recently screwed up his entire site. But there's always something new for him to try. Most of the plug-ins I've seen for Movable Type lately concentrate on attempting to make the product feel less stodgy: adding Ajax to the admin interface, adding tagging, and primitive support for enclosures.

Where are the ground-breaking developments happening?

**Note**: at the moment, the commenting system seems to be screwed up. I've reported it to the fine folks at [TextDrive](http://www.textdrive.com), and I hope it will be fixed soon.
