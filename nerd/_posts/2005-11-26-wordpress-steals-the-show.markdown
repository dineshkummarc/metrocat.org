I converted both [newburyportion](http://newburyportion.com) and [nerd](http://nerd.newburyportion/) to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) this weekend. Everything went almost flawlessly.

I'm really excited about some of the new features I'm able to take advantage of, however, the permalinks aren't quite as nice as the ones I had with MovableType, and the post editing process is a little weird when you add MarkDown.

I still haven't converted our photography section, but I think that's going to wind up using [Flickr](http://flickr.com/). There seems to be good plugin support for Flickr.

I *still* don't like PHP, but then again I didn't like Perl and I ran Movable Type for a long time.
