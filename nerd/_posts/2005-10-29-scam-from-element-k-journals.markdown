I got a *subscription renewal* invoice from Element K Journals in the mail today for <u>Inside Microsoft Windows Server Security</u>, <u>Windows Security Online Answers On-Demand Service</u>, and <u>Microsoft Windows Server Security Discussion Forum</u>.

Both of you who regularly read this site know I am neither a fan of Microsoft or their craptacular operating system. So it shouldn't come as any surprise that I've never subscribed to these journals.

This is a scam. Plain and simple.

The hope of the bastards at Element K Journals is that the spouse of the geek will simply pay the bill. When the unwanted (and probably worthless) "journals" begin to arrive, it will be *surprisingly* difficult to correct the mistake.

Because the scam artist are located in Rochester, NY, I think I may forward the information along with my concerns to Elliot Spitzer's office. I know this is a small-time deal for him, but he might have a minor minion who would be interested enough to *look into it*.
