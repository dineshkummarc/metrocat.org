Although I've decided not to continue purchasing NetNewsWire in the future, I still read [Brent Simmon's blog inessential.com](http://inessential.com). His latest post about [how NetNewsWire reads feeds](http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3307) contains the following statement:

> Itâ€™s important, in this increasingly cross-platform and multiple-gadget world, to be able to get your feeds anywhere, anytime.

Can anyone explain why this is true? Exactly why is it important to be able to "get my feeds" anywhere? And why is it important to be able to get my feeds *anytime*?

I think it would be reasonable to say people want these options. And I can certainly understand why NewsGator or anyone else who stands to profit from offering services around this desire want us to feel this is important. But I can't believe anyone actually relies on an RSS feed for time critical or *important* information? Exactly what would be the harm if I don't hear about the latest buzz-word compliant social bookmarking or photo-sharing Web site until I get home from work and can fire up my browser or feed reader?

For those of use who were paying attention during the whole Push Technology phase of the Internet, this has striking similarities. And I think in five years the end result will be the same.
