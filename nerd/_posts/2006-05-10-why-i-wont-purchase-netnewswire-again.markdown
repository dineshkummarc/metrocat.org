[Version 2.1 of NetNewsWire is now available](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire2.1.php) and as a registered user, the upgrade is free. That's a good thing, because if I had to pay for it, NewsGator (new owners of Ranchero software) wouldn't get a dime.

Is there something wrong with NetNewsWire? Not that I'm aware of. From all accounts it's still as fine a piece of software as when I first purchased it -- who knows when (*update*: turns out it was October of last year).

But the new version requires me to sign up for a NewsGator account in order to activate the software. That's right, requires. You don't sign up, you can't activate. You don't activate, you can't use the software. 

If I had wanted a NewsGator account, I would already have one. It's not like I'm unaware of their existence. They just don't offer anything that interests me.

This is just like when Radio Shack would ask for your Name and Address just to buy some fucking batteries.

The saddest thing is Ranchero/NewsGator already has all the information they forced me to provide: I had to provide it when I purchased NetNewsWire from Kagi software. I still have the email receipt (**Invoice #** 921219547). They even have my home address.

So obviously, I don't have a problem sharing my information when it's actually necessary and warranted.

Although I'll be using NNW 2.1 for the time being, I'll be looking for an alternative that doesn't require me to sign up for any stupid collateral accounts.
