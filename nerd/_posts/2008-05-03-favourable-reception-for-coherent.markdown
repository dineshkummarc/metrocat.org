I recently announced the upcoming [release of Coherent 1.0](http://coherentjs.org/docs/release/coherent-10-release-candidate-1) and I've been very pleased by the positive reception the library has received.

Lots of folks have come out of the woodwork to either say they've been looking for something like this for ages. I guess there are more fans of the Apple development model than I thought. And obviously a lot of us build Web applications either for a living or in our spare time.

As I've been working on some features I've planned for 1.1, I've run across some [strange problems with selectors](http://coherentjs.org/docs/development/selectors-and-bindings) which seems to tie into [John Resig's recent blog post about selectors](http://ejohn.org/blog/thoughts-on-queryselectorall/).
