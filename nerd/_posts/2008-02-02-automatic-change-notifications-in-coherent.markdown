I've written a little bit about an exciting new feature in the Coherent library: [automatic change notifications](http://coherentjs.org/news/features/automatic-change-notifications). In short, this reduces the amount of code you need to write and if your application only needs to support a Class A browser (like Safari 3 or Firefox), you can rely on JavaScript's support for property getter/setter methods to further reduce your work.

Now if I can only figure out what I'm going to do about Arrays and change notifications, then I could wrap up the changes needed for 1.0.
