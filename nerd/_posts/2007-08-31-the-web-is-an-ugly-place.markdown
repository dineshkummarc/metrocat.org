I found a link on [Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com) today about a [date picker widget that uses Prototype and Scriptaculous](http://ajaxian.com/archives/datepicker-using-prototype-and-scriptaculous). But why does it have to look so ugly?

I recently finished writing a date picker for work. I'm not entirely pleased with it, but it seems to work OK.

Of course, my standards are a bit higher when it comes to visual styling and interaction. So instead of simply updating the content when you click on the left & right arrows, the present calendar actually slides out and the new calendar slides in.

The Web doesn't _have_ to be an ugly place.
