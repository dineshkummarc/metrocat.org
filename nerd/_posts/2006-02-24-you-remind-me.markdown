Just yesterday I noticed something peculiar about Microsoft Outlook:

> When I'm creating a meeting to which multiple people are invited, *I* get to determine when *they* get reminded of the meeting.

That just seems wrong.




There ought to be a configuration somewhere that allows me to specify my default reminder settings. For example, I'm slow and like to be reminded at least 30 minutes in advance of my next meeting. (I'd also like to be reminded *again* 5 minutes before but that's another story.) On the other hand, someone with a better memory might not want to be reminded at all.

Or worse, my former manager frequently forgot to set a reminder at all. Then when only a few people showed up to his meetings he was confused. When I'm in the *zone*, if the computer (actually my phone now) doesn't remind me of an appointment, I'm never going to know I missed it until it's way too late.
