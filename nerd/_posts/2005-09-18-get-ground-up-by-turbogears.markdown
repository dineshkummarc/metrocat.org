I just finished watching the [20 minute screen cast of TurboGears](http://www.turbogears.org/docs/wiki20/20MinuteWiki.mov). Now I'm eager to download it and try it out.

I actually spent most of this weekend looking for a decent Web development environment -- I don't do Perl or PHP (I think they're both craptacular languages) -- and although I'd rather use JavaScript on the server side, I think Python will be an interesting twist.

And whatever happened to AxKit? It looked good enough to make me interested in learning a little Perl, but then there's been no development since 2003...
