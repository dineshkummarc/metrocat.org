I've been working somewhat furiously to get Coherent ready for its first release. There's already code in the wild on a heavy-traffic e-commerce site that is using it, but there is still a bit more testing I'd like to do. And the documentation could use another brush up.

If you've downloaded either the ZIP file or pulled down the SVN repository, you should probably update to get the latest bug fixes and other goodies.
