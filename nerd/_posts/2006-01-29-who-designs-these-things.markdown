For Christmas I bought a [Canon Selphy CP510](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AZ2BAW/qid=1138578468/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-5586289-6739947?n=507846&s=photo&v=glance) for Anna. It's a really cool dye sublimation printer that will print up to 4x6 photographs. The photos are water proof and basically every bit as good as those you'd get from CVS or Walgreens.

Except some idiot designed the physical unit.

The "front" of the device contains the socket for the power cable.

The "right side" of the device contains the socket for an USB cable.

And the "rear" of the device contains a pull out cable for connecting directly to cameras.

Who the hell thought this up?

I mean really. I know this is a *compact* device (that's what the C stands for in CP), but this is just stupid. Add to all this the paper cartridge sticking out of the "rear" of the printer and you have a complete mess.

In addition, you can't use the device via Macintosh USB Printer Sharing. This means you actually have to plug a computer into the device to print a photo. How archaic. Our [Brother HL-5170DN](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001JXAGQ/qid=1138578826/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-5586289-6739947?n=507846&s=electronics&v=glance) plugs into the USB port on the Airport Express -- we can print from anywhere in the house.

On the other hand, the photos are pretty nice...
