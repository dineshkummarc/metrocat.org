As part of my job I use the Microsoft JavaScript language reference all day long (the product I work on embeds the Microsoft Script engine). Up until today, I've been able to access this site via FireFox, and although it didn't work as good as the MSIE version, it worked OK.

Today, when I went to the MSDN page for JavaScript it was missing. Eventually, I tracked down the new link [As an aside, I go to no end of trouble to make certain all my old links work, you'd think a company as big as Microsoft wouldn't have the same problems. Maybe they don't care that they break my bookmarks periodically.] only to discover that the site is completely unusable in FireFox.

For some reason, Microsoft feels that the properties and methods should be hidden behind little non-disclosure buttons. These buttons don't seem to work at all for FireFox.

No sweat. I'll just report a bug.

Except I need a Passport account to file a bug. So I filed my bug here. (Where no one will see it.)
