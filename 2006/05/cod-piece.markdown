This evening Anna and I enjoyed some Wicked Chowder. This is a variation of a recipe called [Killer Shrimp](http://www.cyber-kitchen.com/recipes/Killer_Shrimp.htm) which I first read about on [Matthew Haughey's Ten Years of My Life](http://tenyearsofmylife.com/2005/01/16/).

## Ingredients ##
* 2 tbsps fresh or dried rosemary
* 2 tsps thyme
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
* 1/2 tsp fennel seed
* 1 tsp celery seed
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper
* 2 qts clam broth
* 6 ozs tomato paste
* 1/2 stick butter
* 1lb shrimp
* 1lb cod fillet
* 1 loaf of sour dough bread

##Directions##
1. Partially grind up the rosemary, thyme, and fennel seed. You should really still be able to see pieces of the spices rather than just spice dust.

2. Put everything except the shrimp and cod into a pot and simmer for an hour or two until the broth has reduced a bit.

3. Just before you're ready to eat, add the cod and continue cooking for a few minutes. The cod should basically fall apart. The shrimp only take a minute or two to cook, so toss them in just before you serve the soup.

4. Serve with warmed bread. We get this great sour dough that has huge cloves of garlic roasted in olive oil baked right in it. It's wonderful.

5. Wish you'd made more.

Next time we make it, I'm going to experiment with adding some vegetables. Nothing crazy, just carrot slices, potatoes, and other simple things like that.
