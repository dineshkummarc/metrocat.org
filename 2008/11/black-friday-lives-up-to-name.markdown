If [this][1] is the "Christmas Spirit" I've heard so much about, I think I really may become a pagan after all. 

In other news, Jeff and I celebrated our anniversary by taking Miss Molly to see [Bolt][2], and had a delicious little Carvel ice cream cake. Five years later, and we still take this day off from the madness of life to remember the simple things, the things that don't cost a dime- especially love.
