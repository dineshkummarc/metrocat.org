The Beatle's <u>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</u> begins:

>It was twenty years ago today,<br>
>Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play<br>
>They've been going in and out of style<br>
>But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.

It occurred to me this morning that this summer is the twentieth anniversary of my first job in the software industry. My father finagled a summer job for me with the local hospital in their IT department. I'm pretty certain they didn't really _need_ me, but they did _pay_ me to write software. I doubt it was very good software, after all I was only 16. But there probably weren't more than a handful of people in the area who were capable of hand-tuning algorithms in assembly.
