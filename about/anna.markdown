title: About Anna
---

Born and raised in [Kingston][1], NY, I spent the first twenty years of my existence dreaming of an exciting life of adventure outside of that small city and extremely rural suburbs (aka [Hurley][2]). Only in hindsight do I begin to recognize that the tranquility of the woods and fields where I spent many a long, lazy day gave me a safe base from which to dream, and write.

I was an academic overachiever, graduating from [Kingston High School][3] in 1993, number 12 in my class. If I had really cared more for grades and rank than for writing, I highly doubt I would have enrolled in three English classes per semester of my senior year.

And what a year it was. I appeared on a cable television show called [Night After Night with Allan Havey][4], a local radio program to discuss political issues, and in a [magazine][5] regarding then-President Clinton's visit to Hyde Park (where I served in a minor capacity assisting the Secret Service.) I was also a finalist in the [Scholastic Art and Writing Awards][6], for a science fiction story I wrote, appropriately entitled, "Politically (In)Correct." (No relation to the television show, which appeared much later thank-you-very-much).

In part due to an introduction to [Bard College][7] President, Leon Botstein, at the afore-mentioned Hyde Park event, I received a decent scholarship to attend my alma mater. Still dreaming of becoming a writer, I started college life as an English major, but was soon lured to the dark side- [Film][8]. In the dark cave that was the Avery Film Center, I created some wacky animation, and met some cool fellow filmmakers, including: Helder ["Hellboy"][9] Mira, [Luke][10] Sieczek, [Dan][11] Martinico, and [Nick][12] Rucka. Inspired by the antics of the founder of the People's Film Department, [Adolfas Mekas][13], and blessed by [St. Tula][14], we were the brothers and token sister of the Revolucion Room.

I graduated in 1997, and immediately ran screaming from the safe bosom of the east coast- into the open maw of the big bad evil west coast. San Francisco, CA at the height of the dot-com boom was simultaneously a fascinating and a frightening place. There was plenty of money to be had, and plenty of places to spend it. Unfortunately, I just ran up debt. I dabbled in film, but actually worked as a/an: oft-abused waitress, food prep slave, file clerk, video store clerk, case clerk, and finally, deeply depressed paralegal.

Tail between my legs, I packed my Honda to the roof and spent a week torturing my little sister, Laura, by driving us both back to the Hudson Valley. It was 2001, and while I escaped the west coast before the dot-com bubble burst, I was back on the east coast for 9/11. All-in-all, it made it difficult to pursue my dreams. Instead, I was just pursuing a paycheck. I made my money as a: screenwriter's assistant, software/website tester, video store clerk, "lumberjill", farm hand (aka pumpkin picker), and administrative assistant for another software company.

In 2003, I eagerly followed Jeff to the Manhattan area, although neither of us was too tickled by life in [Jersey City][15], NJ. I managed to land my first "real" film gig, and learned that the film business might not be for me after all. Although in fairness, it might have had something to do with the excessive summer heat and blackout of 2003. I found myself back in office work just in time for us to return to the Hudson Valley.

We spent a brief few months in [Rhinebeck][16], NY, but long enough for me to hold another couple of jobs.

Finally, at long last, it looks as if we have found a (semi-) permanent home here in Newburyport, MA. I am no longer working, and am doing a lot of thinking about what it is I would like to be when I grow up.

Maybe a writer after allâ€¦
