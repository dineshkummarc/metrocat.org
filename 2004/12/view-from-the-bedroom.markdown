This morning I awoke to find a light dusting of snow covering Newburyport.
Looking out our bedroom window, I found this scene reminiscent of a Norman
Rockwell painting. Of course, had good old Norman been here, heâ€™d have managed
to capture everything without cars zooming through the photo. But then he had
the option of painting the scene as it should be, rather than photographing
the scene as it really is.

Still, I think this captures a little bit of the spirit of Newburyport.
