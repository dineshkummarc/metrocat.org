As Anna and I sat outside Schemmyâ€™s ice cream parlour, this young lady and her
mother walked by pushing a stroller. Seeing our soft serve ice cream cones,
while her mother went in to exchange a few hard earned bills for delightfully
cool ice cream, this young lady entertained her young child by blowing
bubbles.
