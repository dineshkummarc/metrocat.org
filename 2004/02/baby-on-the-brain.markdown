I have a confession to make. Ever since my cousin made her "infamous"
announcement (see [Exciting News][1]), I have been both obsessed with and
terrified by the idea of producing small children.

Jeff seems to be comfortable with the idea of "raising a small crop of
children" as he phrased it in my most recent birthday card.

I am not quite as sold on the idea as I once was.

Granted, I **do** want children. I just don't think I am as ready as I thought
I was before I started listening to Kim describe morning sickness and the
other 7 to 8 months worth of symptoms that sound like more like the
progression of a horrible disease than the progress towards a "joyous event".

And don't even get me started on the topic of labor. I have **never** been
comfortable with the idea of squeezing a little being the size of a watermelon
out an opening that is, well, _not_ watermelon-sized. But then I started
watching Discover Health Channel's program, [ Babies: Special Delivery][2]
(aka "When Babies Attack" according to Jeff), which describes all of the
things that can go wrong with that process, and I felt even more apprehensive.

Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised when our time comes, and it will be easier
than I anticipate. Maybe we'll just adopt.

Maybe I should just stop thinking about it.
