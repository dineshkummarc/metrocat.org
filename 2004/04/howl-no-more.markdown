One of the best aspects of our new home in Rhinebeck, NY is that Augustus no longer howls at night. There must have been something about the Jersey City apartment that drove him nuts. And every night he'd start howling, which would keep us awake until we locked him in the guest bathroom.

Now he is no more annoying than any cat is during the night: he occasionally competes in the Feline 500 with Tim and Magic, or knocks over boxes or fragile items on our shelves.

But that's no problem by comparison to his howling.
