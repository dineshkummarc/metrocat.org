I just noticed a couple layout flaws with the current site design; so I'll be looking at redoing the design in the coming days. I doubt it will change significantly, because I kind of like the current look.

So, on the off chance that you've noticed anything weird (other than the search fields not fitting in the box at the right) please let me know...
