I just got word from the folks at the Village Green Apartments in Rhinebeck, NY: our application was approved. Therefore, as of 1 April our new address will be:

> Jeff &amp; Anna Watkins <br>
> 25 Village Green Apt F <br>
> Rhinebeck, NY 12572 <br>

[ Map & Driving Directions (from Yahoo Maps)][1]

**Update:** Corrected address. Although the landlord has the address listed as _25F Village Green_, I prefer the version that Central Hudson Gas & Electric uses. I figure the utility company might be more accurate.
