I can't believe this. My former home, the State of Georgia, is currently embroiled in controversy over whether to teach alternative <i>theories</i> regarding the origins of life on Earth. This is just ludicrous.

This is from a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">NY Times</a> article entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/30/education/30GEOR.html">Georgia Takes on 'Evolution'</a>. These people are <i>serious</i>; however, they need to take time out from thumping their bibles and look at the world around them. Really look at some fossils. Really look at some evolutionary evidence.

Of course, the crux of the issue is that they're embarrassed to be related to apes.
