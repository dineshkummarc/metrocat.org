Although I applied the full power of my awesome detective skills to the
problem, I was unable to determine the significance of this head in the wall.
I spoke with a guy in a pub and he had no idea what it was all about. Hadn’t
even heard of it. Imagine…

But this photograph does prove we encountered some nice weather.

Many of the fields are bounded by stone walls made out of the same luminescent
limestone from which the cottages and towns are built. Of course, occasionally
you’ll run across some joker who thinks an electric fence is a pretty good
idea. Maybe this is his head.
