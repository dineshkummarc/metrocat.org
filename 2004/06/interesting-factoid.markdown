I was listening to <a href="http://www.marketplace.org">Market
Place</a> on my way home this afternoon and the announcer made an
interesting statement:

> Since the beginning of the "recovery", more people have found jobs working in collections agencies than have found jobs working for all the manufacturing companies combined.

I still have to check the exact wording; but that's a pretty damning
bit of information.
