There's an interesting article on <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber's web site</a> entitled <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows">Broken Windows</a>. John makes an excellent case that the best way to compare Windows and Macintosh is not with a new computer, but with a computer that has seen at least six months of use:

This bears out my own experience: Mac's simply stay stable longer. I've never had an installation of Windows that lasted very long at all before it was polluted or corrupt in some fashion.
