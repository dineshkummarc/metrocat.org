Last Friday I was reminded why we chose to live in Rhinebeck, NY, rather than continue living close to Manhattan. After ducking out of work an hour early, I walked into the Village and visited Crystal Lake. Along the western shore of the lake is a small waterfall which feeds a stream with a number of cascades. I sat down on the rocks beside the stream, took off my socks and shoes, and because it was a sweltering afternoon, put my feet in the cold running water.

Anna joined me there after she got home from work. We sat for a bit: talking about our days and plans for the weekend. Finally, we got up and walked into the Village to get a couple drinks (she's partial to an <a href="http://www.manhattanspecial.com/products_pure_espresso.html"> Espresso Soda from Manhattan Special</a>) before walking home again.

Certainly there are beautiful parks in Manhattan. And very likely there are streams in those parks where I might have wiggled a toe or two. But I doubt we could have been alone there. I doubt I would have heard the birds chirping in the trees or the snake as it slithered through the grass.
