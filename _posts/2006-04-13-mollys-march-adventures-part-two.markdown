I'd better finish this two part tale before April is over as well. Now, where was I?

Molly visited her New York grandparents one weekend (March 24-26), and was off to see her Florida family the next (March 31-April 3).

She managed to complete the next two firsts in one trip:

3\. FIRST BUS RIDE

AND

4\. FIRST PLANE RIDE

Molly handled both surprisingly well, especially the bus trip (she fell asleep.) She did cry on the plane, but was relatively easily soothed. She screamed twice, both times when we brought her into the cramped airplane bathroom to attempt to change her after she let out some horrific-smelling farts. Those were even more embarrassing than the screaming.

Molly earned her wings from a very enthusiastic flight attendant. He was delighted to meet her, although she apparently couldn't say the same, and cried whenever he saw her. Poor man.

A brief two and a half hours later, and we were soaking up the warmth of the sun and Grandma and Grandpa Watkins in Florida. The rest of the weekend was a blur of activity and eating- much eating.

Here are some highlights (click on each highlight for more info):

<b>FAMILY TIME</b>

Molly was able to spend a little time with each family member, plus a little bit extra for the grandparents. She also met Aunt Dianne and Uncle Joe for the first time, along with their incredible bird collection.

Sorry Grandma. Molly doesn't do "happy".

Grandpa could never have a serious conversation with his little buddy.

Maybe it was hard to do serious in that hat.

Who entertained who more?

Near the end of the day, Molly both looks and acts like her father in the enthusiasm department.

<b>BATH TIME</b>

As the caption for the first photo below mentions, this was a very special bath in a very special bathtub. Molly became the third generation of Watkinses to rub a dub in this tub, and Jeff and Grandma Watkins were there to record it.

All clean, and all smiles.

<b>OUR LITTLE TOURIST</b>

Molly managed another first in Florida:

5\. FIRST WARM/HOT WEATHER 

Although Molly seemed to enjoy not having to be thoroughly bundled, she still had to be shaded to protect her fair skin. We didn't want to introduce her to her first sunburn as well.

All she needed was a camera around her neck.

80-something degrees was quite a shock for us northerners.

Molly is rather well insulated, and as she is yet unable to partake of the appropriate amount of lemonade to counter the heat, we decided to head inside.

<b>THE RIDE HOME</b>

Our four days down South ended rather quickly, and soon we were back on our way to the frozen (but thawing) North.

Happily home and back in our "routine", we are resting and recovering before our next travels!

Thank you again to our wonderful hosts! See you soon!
