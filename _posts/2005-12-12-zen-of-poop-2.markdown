Just a quick update to the last post: a few moments ago, Molly completely filled her diaper. Filled, as in no more room for anything else. So does this mean that Fathers Merrin and Karras were at work expelling Satan from Molly's rectum? I've no idea, but it'll give me something to think about tonight.
