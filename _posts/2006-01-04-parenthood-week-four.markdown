Ten observations typed quickly, before Molly wakes up:

1. In spite of her best efforts, Molly cannot irritate me enough to make me feed her to the dingos/hungry cats.

2. Her screams can, however, make me WANT to feed her to the dingos. Or sell her to the pirates. Or rip my heart out with a plastic spork.

3. New parents really do want to talk about nothing except a baby's bodily functions. That, and how cute she is.

4. Molly has a very clever habit of being completely silent in public, which earns her praise from strangers and family alike. As soon as she knows she is home, she resumes crying. Sneaky baby.

5. Molly will always keep me guessing. She was a very good baby for almost a week, and then had a screamfest to end all screamfests last night, for no apparent reason. At approximately 2am.

6. There is no exact science to measuring a baby's length. According to the measurements taken by two separate pediatricians, Molly is shrinking. Coincidentally, so are her clothes, so something is wrong with this picture.

7. The Christmas holiday season is a crrr-azy time to have a new baby and be sleep deprived!

8. I will most likely never again stay up until midnight on New Year's Eve. I may however, be awakened about that time.

9. Babies are much, much happier when they can start to see the world around them. Or at least distracted enough to stay quiet longer.

10. While having Jeff home has been a blessing, Molly and I can survive while he is at work. But we're all happier when he is here.
