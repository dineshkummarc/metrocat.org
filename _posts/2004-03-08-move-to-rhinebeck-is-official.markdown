<p>I just got word from the folks at the Village Green Apartments in
Rhinebeck, NY: our application was approved. Therefore, as of 1 April
our new address will be:</p>
<p>Jeff & Anna Watkins<br/>
25 Village Green Apt F<br/>
Rhinebeck, NY 12572</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Corrected address. Although the landlord has the
address listed as <i>25F Village Green</i>, I prefer the version that
Central Hudson Gas & Electric uses. I figure the utility company
might be more accurate. </p>
