Yesterday was an incredibly beautiful day. We put the top down and motored out
to Plum Island. While walking around the end of the Island, we encountered
this sign. What bridge is this, I wonder? That water out there, thatâ€™s the
Atlantic ocean. So, again, I wonder, what bridge could the sign be referring
to?
