The other day, We wanted to watch a DVD on my Dell laptop. Instead
of popping the DVD in the drive and enjoying the cinematic horror that

We ultimately watched the DVD on Anna's PowerBook, because the Dell
was taking *so* long to download Windows Media Player.

Best of Christopher Walken</a>. I figured that we could now watch it on the Dell. However, when I put the disc in the drive, Windows rewarded me with the message:
