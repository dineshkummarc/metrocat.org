I've decided to split the technology side of things from this web site into its own. I've dubbed the new site [nerd.newburyportion](http://metrocat.org/nerd/). The first article is about [debugging JavaScript applications using trace messages](http://metrocat.org/nerd/2005/07/30/debugging-javascript-applications-tracing) is up. I'd love to get some feedback.
