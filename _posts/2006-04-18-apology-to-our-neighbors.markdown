Just for the record, I would like to state that our Molly is still completely intact. We have not removed any limbs, or otherwise harmed a single hair on her head.

You wouldn't know it by the screaming of the past couple of nights, though, would you?

I am soooooo sorry for the insane shrieking you have bore witness to in the wee hours. I have never heard before, nor would I ever care to hear again, such an earpiercing, heartrending cry. Believe me, it was even worse in person.

All I know is this:

The last couple of days Molly has been thrashing around more than usual, and on many occasions, she has suddenly rolled from her back to her belly. This is how I have found her in both instances. I imagine this is both disorienting and frightening.

The recently filled diapers I am certain do not help either.

I have tried my best to have her needs met as quickly as possible, but in the meantime...

I can only hope this will pass soon. Our collective sanity may depend upon it.

In the meantime, I often my sincerest and most humble apologies,

Anna
