I distinctly recall hating my footed pyjamas when I was a youngster. If my failing memory serves, I had a yellow pair that were just hideous.

Poor Miss Molly. She now has a pair of pink footed pyjamas. They're a light fleece, so they should keep her plenty warm while she sleeps -- because Anna insists on having every window and door wide open no matter how cold it gets outside. I just hope she'll forgive me for inflicting on her what I so hated as a child.

**Fixed:** Anna "corrected" the spelling of pyjamas in the title. I've fixed it.
