I distinctly recall hating my footed pyjamas when I was a youngster. If my failing memory serves, I had a yellow pair that were just hideous.

<div class="figure"><a href="http://newburyportion.com/gallery/show/recent/photo/244287829"><img class="photo" src="http://static.flickr.com/82/244287829_7a16b93ab3_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Not Quite What She Expected" border="0" /></a> </div>

Poor Miss Molly. She now has a pair of pink footed pyjamas. They're a light fleece, so they should keep her plenty warm while she sleeps -- because Anna insists on having every window and door wide open no matter how cold it gets outside. I just hope she'll forgive me for inflicting on her what I so hated as a child.

**Fixed:** Anna "corrected" the spelling of pyjamas in the title. I've fixed it.
