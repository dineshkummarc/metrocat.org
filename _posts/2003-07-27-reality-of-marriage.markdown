The reality of getting married has finally begun to sink into my subconscious. I had a dream last night about our wedding day. And while the main "characters" in this dream were definitely Scruffy and I, the wedding was nothing like what I hope will happen. Imagine <i>me</i> in a large, poufy, white dress with larger, poufier 80's hair! But the important thing is, no matter how things went wrong, and grew more and more choatic, I was still happy. That's what love will do to you.

Hopefully next month Jeff and I will be able to determine more of the details, and thereby ease some of my anxiety about planning this otherwise happy event.
