Not much can be said about these guys. Any time thereâ€™s a village fete or any
other sort of festival, the Morris Dancers come out. Everyone gets a good
chuckle.

These guys were performing the morning of the Bank Holiday (31 May). The rest
of the time they probably lead normal, respectable lives.
