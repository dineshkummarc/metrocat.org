<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.marketplace.org">Market
Place</a> on my way home this afternoon and the announcer made an
interesting statement:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Since the beginning of the "recovery", more people have found
	jobs working in collections agencies than have found jobs working
	for all the manufacturing companies combined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still have to check the exact wording; but that's a pretty damning
bit of information.</p>
