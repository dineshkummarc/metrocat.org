<p>Anna has a new favourite movie. It features Charlton Heston and is
set in post apocalyptic Los Angeles. What movie is it?</p>
<p><b><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0067525/">The Omega
Man</a></b></p>
<p>I'll be buying a copy of this movie for Anna's birthday...</p>
<p>She once warned me that she might be forced to run away with her
previous idol, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0132257/">Bruce
Campbell</a>; but now I suspect that she might run away with Heston.</p>
