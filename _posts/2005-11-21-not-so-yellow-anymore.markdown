I repainted the Bean's room over the weekend. The new yellow is much more mild -- almost an antique white with a yellow cast to it. Anything is better than the fluorescent yellow-green we picked the first time.

Of course, now I'm a paintin' fool. I've a quart of a nice blue that I want to use in the kitchen and possibly bathroom. And there's still half a gallon of yellow looking for a home.
