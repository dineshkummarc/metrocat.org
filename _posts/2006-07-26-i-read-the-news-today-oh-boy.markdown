I just read this news item on CNN.com:

[Iranians volunteer to fight Israel][1], and all I can say is the world must be coming to an end. 

Am I being overly dramatic? Perhaps. But it would appear to me that this is all the current administration needs as an excuse to take action against Iran, who is already on our hit list. Bush and friends are looking for another holy crusade of their own.

Some days I feel guilty for bringing a child into this madness. I hope that she will be strong enough and wise enough not only to survive, but perhaps to change this pattern of violence and insanity for the better. And I especially hope that there will be others like her.
