<p>In the September issue of <a
href="http://digitaljournalist.org/">The Digital Journalist</a>, Peter
Howe has an interesting take on the recent Republican National
Convention. Howe's article,<br/><a title="The Uncivil War by Peter
Howe" href="http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0409/howe.html">The
Uncivil War</a>, highlights some of the most disturbing and long
reaching aspects of the political divide in America:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0409/howe.html">
	<p>This column was late as usual, but the cause this time was
	somewhat more depressing than my neurotic inability to stick to a
	schedule. I was most of the way through what I had intended to
	write when I started watching the Republican National Convention. I
	was so disturbed by what I saw and heard that I deleted what I had
	written and decided to start again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Howe points out that mere existence of opposition is sufficient to
whip Republicans into a frenzy of sneering, mean-spirited attacks on
all who would question them. Is this really how we want our country to
be?</p>
