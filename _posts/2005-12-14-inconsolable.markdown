Molly just finished an incredible 10 minute screaming fit. I'm not certain how she found the time to breathe -- maybe she's already mastered the circular breathing technique popular with singers and wind-instrument musicians.

Nothing would soothe her: not a changed diaper, not a second changed diaper, not my thumb (to suck on, of course), nothing.

It was almost as if she'd just discovered there was a Republican in the White House.
