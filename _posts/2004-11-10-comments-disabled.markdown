Returning from vacation, I noticed an enormous amount of spam comments trying to entice visitors into clicking on advertisements for "cheap" pharmaceuticals.

Until I decide what to do about this, I've disabled comments on all posts. Unfortunately, the pages still have the comment forms at the bottom (I goofed when building them), but submitting comments won't work.

More later...
