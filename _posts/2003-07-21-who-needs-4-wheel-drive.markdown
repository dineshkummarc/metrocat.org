<p>On Sunday, Anna and I went for a drive. We put the top down and
headed up to her Cousin Kim's house in Orange Co., NY. After a brief
visit with Kim, her Husband. Pumpkin the Cat, and their new puppy
Rusty, we drove west into the green woods of Pennsylvania, where we
promptly got a little lost. Eventually, we returned to the Delaware
River area where we discovered the town of Walpack, NJ.</p>

<p>Of course, discovering the town wasn't enough. I saw a small road
leading away into the hills and decided we should follow it. This road
quickly degraded into a shell-pocked dirt track, which necessitated a
drop into second gear for the better part of two miles. After
soliciting directions from a passing pickup truck, we found our way (so
slowly) to a little waterfall. At the base of the waterfall is a map of
the area, complete with a "You are Here" marker. The map didn't make us
feel hopeful about pressing on: we were only a tenth of the way down
the road.</p>
<p>We turned around and headed back (slowly, very slowly) to the main
road. From there we drove south to Blairstown, NJ for dinner. We
stopped at a pizza joint run by Lou, who claims to make the best pizza
in the world. His claims weren't entirely unfounded: the pizzas are
made with fresh crushed tomatoes, soft mozzarella, and a thin, tasty
crust. Along with a fine pizza, Lou served up a lot of local
information. From his perspective, Blairstown makes an excellent
location to raise a family; but a poor place to run a business.</p>
