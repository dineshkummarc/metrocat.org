I'm sitting in a coffee shop in Seattle and listening to the conversations around me: at three of the nearby tables a recently ex-Microsoft employee pitching himself.

One of the guys is talking to a local VC â€” but his idea must be really dumb, because the VC guy just doesn't look engaged. Another guy was a mid-level manager (who might actually still be at Microsoft but who's seen the writing on the wall) and the last sounds like he was something of a pretty competent developer.

(Oooh, the guy talking to the VC just said, "hocky-stick growth".)

Another table nearby is talking about their latest Web 2.0 thingy. It's really hard to tell what they heck they're planning to build, but they're talking about social networks too...
