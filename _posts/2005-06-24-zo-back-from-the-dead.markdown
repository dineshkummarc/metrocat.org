This afternoon I picked up Anna's 12" PowerBook, zo&euml;, from the Apple Store. They replaced the hard drive with one that didn't have bad blocks, but more importantly, they were able to restore the data from the old drive.

It looks like we lost all the Quicken financial data, but all the photos seem to be intact.

Anna seems pretty happy -- especially as zo&euml; will be upgraded to Tiger.
