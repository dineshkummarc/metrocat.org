Friday at work, I received a slightly panicked call from Anna: her 12" PowerBook G4 had crashed. It had been acting slightly weird for some time (I thought it was just because she had a paltry 256MB of RAM) and had finally died. It wouldn't boot at all, she said.

When I got home, I first tried accessing the hard drive via FireWire target mode, but that didn't work. I then tried using Disk Utility from the laptop's install CD, but Disk Utility couldn't even find the drive. That's not a good sign.

When the Apple Hardware Test application (on the install CD) found a major error with the hard drive, we decided to put our fate in the hands of an Mac Genius. As I write, they are running my copy of [DataRescue](http://www.prosofteng.com/products/data_rescue.php) in the hope of salvaging the contents of Anna's home folder.

That home folder contains our Quicken file containing financial data dating back to 1998, the only copy of the [photos from our honeymoon in the Cotswolds](/honeymoon-in-the-cotswolds), many years worth of archived email, and all of Anna's writing. You can, no doubt, understand why we're keen on seeing it restored.

I just downloaded a copy of [Synk](http://www.decimus.net/synk/) last night and will help Anna develop a comprehensive backup plan to (hopefully) avoid something like this in the future.
