Good gods! What's with all the bloody snow? Last night we received yet more snow: nasty, foul, and evil stuff falling maliciously from out of an otherwise innocent sky to ruin my life.

Yes, I know we deliberately moved to the North Shore of Massachusetts -- an act which nearly ensured our complete inundation with fluffy white crap from out of the sky. We *could* have moved to [Key West][key-west] where it's always warm and all you have to worry about is the occasional pesky hurricane. Or slightly farther afield is [Belize][belize] -- an English-speaking country down in Central America.

Granted, there's hardly *any* work for someone like me in places like this. But then again, who really wants to work when you're living in a tropical paradise? Especially in Belize where the cost of living is much lower. Maybe I should just let Anna get a job and support me. I could lay about on the beach every day, drink tropical fruit juice with other stuff in it (and oh! what other stuff!)...

But the reality is that I've got about 5 inches of filthy, evil, wet muck to shovel away from my car so I can spin the tires uselessly before giving up and taking the wife-mobile to work.
