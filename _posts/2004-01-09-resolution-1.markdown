I always suspected no one reads this blog, and so I felt silly posting anything at all. Therefore, one of my many new year's resolutions is going to be making this site interesting enough so that the few sorry souls who find themselves here have something to look at aside from my blabbing, and to consistently lure new and unsuspecting souls to join the party!

Either that, or I will secede from this site and create a place of my own which will consist <b>only</b> of my babbles.

Yeah, right.

More resolutions will be announced, so that you can pester me about them later...
