Anna and I were joking around about how we won't have the house to ourselves again for another 18 to 21 years. I lamented the fact that I'll be old and grey before we have the house to ourselves again. Anna quickly asked, "How will we know if you're grey?"

That's the smart-ass mother of my child...
