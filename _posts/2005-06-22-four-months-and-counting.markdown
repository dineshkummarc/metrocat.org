As of Monday, Wee Watkins is officially 16 weeks (4 months) in the making. Also as of Monday, my first trimester eating frenzy, combined with the "bean's" growth, has resulted in a real-life baby belly. Unfortunately, not all of it is baby...

I swear that I have felt the flutter of little limbs, which is very cute now, but soon enough I will be wishing that Wee Watkins takes it easy on his/her poor mama.

Which reminds me. In less than three weeks, we will most likely find out whether Wee is a he or a she! I can hardly wait, and I know Jeff and the aspiring grandparents are equally excited.
