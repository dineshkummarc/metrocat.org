Iâ€™ve always liked the look of black and white photos. It would be very cool if
Canon would make a digital SLR that was B&W only. Due to the weird way digital
cameras produce colour from the light striking sensors which are only
sensitive to light intensity and not colour, this would actually produce a
much higher quality image.
