I have in my hot little hands a one year contract to provide software development services to <a href="http://www.sentillion.com/">Sentillion Software</a>. So, at last, I'll be back at work in the software industry; this time actually writing software.

Sentillion is located in Andover, MA. While I'd been targeting the southern NH area, this is almost as good. Andover has some significant things going for it:

* Close to the border of MA and NH: many people who work in Andover live in southern NH.
* Close to Boston
* Close to an REI store
* Close to an Apple store
* Reasonable cost of living (keep in mind I'm still comparing against Manhattan and Jersey City)
* Close to cool historic towns (Lowell, Lawrence, etc.)

My first day is next Monday, 18 October. Unfortunately, I'll be living out of an hotel until we're able to find a new apartment. I'm not looking forward to breaking our current lease, breaking our cell phone contracts, and dealing with all the other miscellaneous issues relating to moving. We just went through all this in April.
