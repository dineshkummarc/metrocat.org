<p>I have in my hot little hands a one year contract to provide
software development services to <a href="http://www.sentillion.com/">Sentillion Software</a>. So, at last,
I'll be back at work in the software industry; this time actually
writing software.</p>
<p>Sentillion is located in Andover, MA. While I'd been targeting the
southern NH area, this is almost as good. Andover has some significant
things going for it:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Close to the border of MA and NH: many people who work in
	Andover live in southern NH.</li>
	<li>Close to Boston</li>
	<li>Close to an REI store</li>
	<li>Close to an Apple store</li>
	<li>Reasonable cost of living (keep in mind I'm still comparing
	against Manhattan and Jersey City)</li>
	<li>Close to cool historic towns (Lowell, Lawrence, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>My first day is next Monday, 18 October. Unfortunately, I'll be
living out of an hotel until we're able to find a new apartment. I'm
not looking forward to breaking our current lease, breaking our cell
phone contracts, and dealing with all the other miscellaneous issues
relating to moving. We just went through all this in April.</p>
