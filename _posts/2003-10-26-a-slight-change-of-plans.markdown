Many of you already know the following, but I will apologize in advance for those of you who have yet to discover....

> WE ARE GETTING MARRIED<br>
> (On November 28, 2003)

Originally, we had set the date for June of next year. But those of you who read my last entry, or have heard the whole story directly from yours truly, know that the planning process was proving to be less joyous than I would have hoped.

I was extremely nervous about getting all of the details right, while planning from a few states away. I was also getting increasingly concerned about our ability to pull it off at all, giving my continued lack of permanent employment, and the continued addition of forgotten relatives and long-lost friends to the guest list. And lastly, as much as we adore every single person who would have attended, we also cherish the thought of having a really memorable honeymoon and/or money towards a down payment on our future home.

I expressed these concerns to my dear Scruffy, and with a "yes dear" we decided to make alternate plans. Knowing that our families were due to spend Thanksgiving with us made choosing another day surprisingly simple.

So, the day after Thanksgiving, we will meet at City Hall in Manhattan to have a blissfully brief ceremony (about two minutes), and then return to Jersey City to have our reception (about two hours).

I look forward to posting more details, but I must keep some details (like my dress) secret until the day after.

Much love,
Anna "soon-to-be-Watkins" Piskoz
