<p>Only four weeks to go before the wedding. Everything seems to be
coming together just fine. We still need to order the wedding cake from
Carvel -- what could be better than an ice cream wedding cake?</p>
<p>Anna would like us to stay in a Hotel the night of our wedding; but
it seems somewhat silly to me that we should pay to stay in a hotel
only blocks away from where we live. Not that I'd mind staying in a
hotel to get away from the singing and bed warming cats; but it still
seems silly. Of course, one of the hotels has rooms with hot tubs...</p>
