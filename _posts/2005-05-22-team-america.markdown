Last night, Anna made me watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/">Team America: World Police</a>, by the creators of South Park.

It was without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. Yes, there were some funny parts -- Kim Jong Il singing "I'm So Lonely" stands out -- but by and large, it was an offensive and disgusting movie.

Interestingly enough, the sets and technical aspects of the movie were outstanding. The remarkable level of detail, clever use of materials, and technical tricks (forced perspective comes to mind) impressed me immensely.

However, Matt Stone and Trey Parker simply ruined the movie with their puerile humour.

If you're thinking of watching this movie, drill a hole in your head instead. It'll be more fun and then you'll have something to talk about afterward.
