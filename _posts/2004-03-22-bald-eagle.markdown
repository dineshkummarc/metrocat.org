<p>Yesterday, as we drove up to Kingston, NY to celebrate a belated St.
Patrick's Day with Dad & Karin, we were strafed by a bald eagle.
Now, I had no idea that there were any bald eagles in the Hudson Valley
area; but after doing only a minimal amount of research I find that
they have been making a come-back since about 1997.</p>
<p>It seems that the Hudson River area has become a popular winter spot
for them: they can feed on fish in the river (all those chemicals must
be an acquired taste) or on animals killed by trains (yes, eagles are
often scavengers). And because activity along the river drops
dramatically during the harsh NY winters (can you say <i>frozen
river</i>?) the eagles are relatively undisturbed.</p>
<p>This is so cool.</p>
<p>Of course, my camera was in the trunk and I was in the middle of
traffic; so I wasn't able to make a photograph of our assailant.</p>
