Today was significant for a number of reasons:

1. There are now exactly 20 days until we say "I do". We still have some details to take care of, but I can truthfully state that everything is nearly ready- even my brain, which has come to terms with the concept of being a "Mrs.", and no longer (in name at least) a Piskoz.
2. One year ago today Jeff returned from Cancun and became my boyfriend for the second time. Apparently, the nearly eight years that had passed since the first time we dated had done nothing to diminish his regard for me (or perhaps had endeared my little "quirks" to him). And yes, I do consider myself lucky in that regard.
3. There was a really neat solar eclipse which Jeff and I briefly witnessed before running for the warmth of our apartment. I can only hope that there will be a freak warm spell at the end of the month, but I will plan for just the opposite. Those of you who will be in attendance should do the same!

I apologize for the brevity of this update, but I hope to make up for it by unveiling (yes, I suppose the pun is intended) some of the wedding details tomorrow.
