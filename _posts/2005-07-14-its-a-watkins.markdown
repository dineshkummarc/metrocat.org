Monday was the big day. The day we were to find out the gender of my little hitchhiker, our own Wee Watkins. Wee had other plans...

I must admit, I was initially very excited about the office visit because after 4 months plus, we were actually going to know what my little hitchhiker was going to be.

I was even more excited when I saw the shadowy images of our <i>baby</i> quite literally bouncing off the walls inside me. I immediately fell in love, and no longer really cared what "it" was. I was just so happy it was there- alive, healthy, and just as crazy as I had hoped.

That the tech guessed it was a girl made me smile. That the baby tried to eat its own hands and foot made me laugh. What a incredible experience, to see our little seamonkey.

I keep looking at the pictures, as if to remind myself that it wasn't a dream. And every once in a while, Wee gives a good kick or two as an additional reminder. Thanks, Wee.

I wanted a little girl so badly, I am afraid to admit yet that it actually might be a she. I want to wait until August 3rd, and our return visit before I completely give over to the "pink side".
