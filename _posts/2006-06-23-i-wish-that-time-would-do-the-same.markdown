Molly is currently learning to crawl. Let me rephrase that sentence. She is <i>teaching herself</i> to crawl, and like her parents, she is a bit of a perfectionist. She practices day and night, even in her sleep. Really. I actually had to go in and comfort her last night after she knocked her head against the side of the crib numerous times. Her eyes remained closed throughout the whole ordeal.

So far, she manages to get up on her knuckles and knees. Then, on her hands and toes, in a most impressive pushup. There are a few different possibilities after this point.

Sometimes, she kicks her heels up into the air and tries to propel herself forward. Usually, she just lands on her face.

Other times she lifts a leg and arm high into the sky and pauses for a minute or two. Perhaps contemplating her next move or just stretching.

Most often she just scoots a little backwards. After a few minutes, she gets bored and either rolls or just turns her body around and rocks back and forth in a new direction.

I still try to applaud her efforts where appropriate, and place objects and myself in front of her to encourage her progress. I can't imagine it will be too much longer -- better start the babyproofing this weekend!
