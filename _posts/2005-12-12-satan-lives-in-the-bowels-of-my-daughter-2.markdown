Our day peaked just a little while ago when our daughter finally pooped. Really. This is what my life has come to: I'm excited that a small, squirmy creature has crapped her pants.

Of course, all day she's been letting out these horrible sulphurous farts. When we took her over to the hospital today for a visit to the Lactation Consultant (there's a whole post right there... but later), I was concerned that she might fart while we were in the elevator and kill us all.

Anna has additional evidence which she claims indicates that The Bean is possessed by Satan or one of his unholy minions. But I'll let her explain it when she gets a chance. Course, she's a bit busy at the moment.
