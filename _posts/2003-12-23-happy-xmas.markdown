We're off to Kingston to celebrate Christmas with Anna's family. 7 am will find us on a bus headed north on the NY Thruway. Of course, this means we have to leave the house at a quarter to 6 am. I know Anna will be at her brightest and most cheerful at that hour.

Because we can't really leave the cats alone for too long, we'll be catching a bus home on either Christmas day or Friday, the day after. That way we'll have the better part of the weekend to recover from our travels and cuddle...

I hope everyone has a fantastic holiday!
