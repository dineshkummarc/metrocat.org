<p>We just returned from Newark Airport; where we picked up Anna's
little sister, Laura. Now Laura's napping (she flew all night, poor
kid); and Anna's starting to get nervous...</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, am about to make myself a cup of tea. Of
course, I need to press my shirt; but that's no sweat.</p>
