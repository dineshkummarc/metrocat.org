Another photograph of the Broadway Tower. When we first visited the tower the
sky was full of leaden clouds and threatening rain (surprise!). But I
recognised this as a great framing for the tower; and when we returned with
the skies more favourable, I jumped at the opportunity to make this photograph
(and about a dozen others).
