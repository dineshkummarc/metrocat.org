<i>Sorry for the missed month everyone- Miss Molly has been keeping us on our toes these days. We will be in sunny Mexico for Molly's 11 month birthday, so at least this post will be just a bit early.</i>

The photo above reminds me to let everyone know that in addition to the photos included in this post there are a number of old and new photos on our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffwatkins/">Flickr</a> site. I sometimes upload additional photos that I don't use in the posts. And, if you are very clever, you can subscribe to the site feed so that you will know as soon as I post a photo, often long before I write the corresponding blog entry.

Now back to our show...

One of the biggest developments in the life of Molly these past months can be summed up with one word:

TEETH!

Molly <i>finally</i> had her first tooth come in, soon after she turned 9 months old. Her second tooth arrived soon after she turned 10 months old. Given her present state of extreme crankiness, and the fact that she is gnawing on everything in sight, including her poor, long-suffering mother, I believe she will get at least one other soon after turning 11 months old. 

It should be an interesting trip.

Fortunately, there have a been a number of distractions, many of them provided by Molly herself as she grows stronger and more able, and begins to explore the world around her. More about her growing skills set in the next post.

We were blessed the past months with really gorgeous weather. Molly and I in particular spent as much time as possible soaking up the warm sun, saving up for the cold we knew would eventually come.

We also had the opportunity to finally explore Boston. While Jeff attended a conference, Molly and I ran amok.

Our first day, we hopped the T and ended up walking through Harvard. Molly was apparently not impressed by the ivy league school, and promptly fell asleep. While she slept, I walked some more and sipped awesome <a href="http://www.burdickchocolate.com/stores-and-cafes-cambridge.asp">hot chocolate</a>. 

Molly woke up in time for lunch, which was incredible <a href="http://www.cafepolonia.com/">Polish</a> food. Are you beginning to sense a theme?

Afterward, we hopped a bus to <a href="http://www.franklinparkzoo.org">Franklin Park Zoo</a>

I think, in all honesty, that I enjoyed it more than she did.

The next day was more fun and frolic. Our friends <a href="http://www.bokardo.com/wedding/">Alana</a> and baby <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bokardo/262884693/in/set-72157594316452937/">Tessa</a> joined us at the <a href="http://www.neaq.org/">New England Aquarium</a>. We had fun for a little while until Molly decided enough was enough, and yelled until I gave her something to eat! Let me tell you, nothing is more fun than carrying a screaming and writhing child through a giant concrete building. I'm surprised they didn't ban us from future visits.

We all had a brief snack before strolling over to (and through) both <a href="http://www.faneuilhallmarketplace.com/">Quincy Market</a> and the North End, where we had lunch.

Looking back, I wish we had taken more pictures, but there is only so much this poor mom can do.

And speaking of doing things, be sure to check out the next post!
