Poor Molly! She was born into a family of wackos. There is no better evidence (that we can offer without truly incriminating ourselves) than the nicknames we have given our daughter. 

Here are some examples:

<ul>

<li>The Bean</li>
<li>The Beanster</li>
<li>The Sea Monkey</li>
<li>The Microsite (courtesy of Papou, aka Evan)</li>
<li>Chewy aka Chewbacca, Wookie (she gnaws on nearly anything)</li>
<li>Spewy (she drools and occasionally regurgitates)</li>
<li>Poopsie (due to her exceedingly full diapers)</li> 
<li>Molly Poopins or just Poopins</li>
<li>Pota-toh, Sweet Potato, Pota-tah, Tater Tot</li>
<li>Screechy</li>
<li>Gamera (or really, any critter from the Godzilla movies)</li>
<li>One-eyed drunken pirate</li>

</ul>

I am certain there are (and will be) more in the future. Feel free to post your ideas- we'll most likely use them at one point or another. But keep it clean folks!
