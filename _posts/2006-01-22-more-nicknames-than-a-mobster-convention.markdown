Poor Molly! She was born into a family of wackos. There is no better evidence (that we can offer without truly incriminating ourselves) than the nicknames we have given our daughter.

Here are some examples:

* The Bean
* The Beanster
* The Sea Monkey
* The Microsite (courtesy of Papou, aka Evan)
* Chewy aka Chewbacca, Wookie (she gnaws on nearly anything)
* Spewy (she drools and occasionally regurgitates)
* Poopsie (due to her exceedingly full diapers)
* Molly Poopins or just Poopins
* Pota-toh, Sweet Potato, Pota-tah, Tater Tot
* Screechy
* Gamera (or really, any critter from the Godzilla movies)
* One-eyed drunken pirate

I am certain there are (and will be) more in the future. Feel free to post your ideas- we'll most likely use them at one point or another. But keep it clean folks!
