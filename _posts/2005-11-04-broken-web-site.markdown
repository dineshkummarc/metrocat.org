It seems our move to the wonderful [TextDrive](http://www.textdrive.com/) wasn't without incident. Our Movable Type installation is missing a critical perl module which is making the home page misbehave a bit (showing more entries than I want) and the comments system seems to be entirely broken with a 412 error (Precondition failed).

I've sent in support requests for both, so we'll see what the response time is.
