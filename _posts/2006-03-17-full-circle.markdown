A friend of mine mentioned the other day (pardon my paraphrasing) that the saga of Molly's stomach had come full circle. 

Indeed it has.

Our little girl is once again on Zantac to help with her apparent antibiotic-induced acid reflux. Zantac mixed with acidophilus for sweetness as well as to help Molly's intestinal tract work a little bit better. I am very, very unhappy to have to give her the Zantac again, but at least I actually believe it may be relevant this time. That, and because she trusts us now, it is much easier to give her the medicine than it was when she was but a couple of weeks old.

In some ways, it has worked. Molly has not woken up screaming since she started the mixture, and sleeps a little more soundly at night. She also has taken a morning nap for the past two mornings, which before now has been unheard of.

Perhaps she is happier because I am finally off my antibiotics. Perhaps she is finally maturing at long last. Or perhaps it is that horrible-tasting medicine.

However, she still screams in the afternoons for no apparent reason. SCREAMS. I have to wear earplugs.

Is she in pain? Is she overwhelmed from the day's activities (I try to keep both of us entertained as best I can)? Is she annoyed that I am trying to put her down for a nap or for the night?

This cannot last forever. I just hope that I don't miss out on her babyhood waiting for this brief, but powerfully difficult and annoying, time to pass.
