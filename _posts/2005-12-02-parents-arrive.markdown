Well, my folks have arrived. They'll be here in Newburyport for the next 5 weeks. Of course, they're here to welcome their first grandchild into the world and to help out where they can once she's here.

I took this photo back in November of 2003 when Anna made me the happiest I've ever been by saying "I do". Fortunately, the family was there to help us celebrate.
