One of Anna's favourite movies is [Fight Club][fight-club]. Partly because her heart-throbs [Ed Norton][ed] and [Brad Pitt][brad] star in it, and partly because it's a cool movie.

Since April, I've been cutting my hair shorter and shorter. This morning was the *ultimate* step: 1/8" fuzz now covers my head. In reference to Fight Club, Anna says I look like a "Space Monkey".

In part this was all prompted by my thinning hair. It didn't have the common sense to simply fall out. No. It had to thin instead. And when my thin hair got the slightest bit long, it looked incredibly goofy, because you could tell how thin it was.

I no longer have any hair to worry about.

Now all I have to worry about is whether to donate my remaining shampoo to charity.
