Anna has the best fianc&eacute; in the world. No. Really. It's true. After months and months of listening to her whine about how she would get rid of a lot of her stuff if she only had a digital camera to photograph it all, I broke down.

Last Friday, I bought her a digital camera. Specifically, a Canon EOS 10D with a 6.3 Megapixel CMOS sensor that will accept any one of the lenses we already own (for my EOS 3 film camera). The 10D is a huge improvement over the Canon EOS D30 that I once owned.

I confess that I really intended this to be a gift for us both; but I plan to milk it for all that it's worth...

P.S. Only twelve more days to go...
