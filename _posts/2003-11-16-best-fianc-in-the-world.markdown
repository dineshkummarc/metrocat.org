<p>Anna has the best fianc&eacute; in the world. No. Really. It's true.
After months and months of listening to her whine about how she would
get rid of a lot of her stuff if she only had a digital camera to
photograph it all, I broke down.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I bought her a digital camera. Specifically, a Canon
EOS 10D with a 6.3 Megapixel CMOS sensor that will accept any one of
the lenses we already own (for my EOS 3 film camera). The 10D is a huge
improvement over the Canon EOS D30 that I once owned.</p>

<p>I confess that I really intended this to be a gift for us both; but
I plan to milk it for all that it's worth...</p>
<p>P.S. Only twelve more days to go...</p>
