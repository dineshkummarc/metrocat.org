We went shopping this afternoon. In addition to everything else, I needed to pick up a new pair of jeans. While in JC Penney we encountered what I call **dirt washed** jeans. They're like any ordinary pair of jeans, except a shovel full of dirt -- authentic dirt too, none of this imitation dirt they're peddling these days -- is added to every batch as they're washed. That way they get that genuine haven't-been-washed-since-I-bought-them look without all the effort.

Ask Anna what the weather outside is like and she'll whisper it in your ear. Not me \`though. If it's worth saying once, it's worth saying loud enough so everyone can hear. So you can imagine how excited Anna was when I launched into a tirade about "kids today".
