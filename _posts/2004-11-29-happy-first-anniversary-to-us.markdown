<p>Well, Scruffy and I managed to survive a very wacky year. It wasn't
altogether bad, just a little overwhelming at times.</p>
<p>Here are some married life stats that should help those who don't
know (or don't recall):</p>
<ul>
	<li>We have lived in three different states: New Jersey, New York,
	and Massachusetts</li>
	<li>We have been out of the country twice: once to England for our
	honeymoon, and once to Cancun for a family reunion</li>
	<li>I have had three jobs; Jeff has had four</li>
	<li>I have nearly maintained my wedding weight; Jeff has lost
	nearly 30 more pounds!</li>
</ul>
<p>2005 looks to be equally full of adventure, and with such a cute and
energetic man by my side, a lot of fun as well! Stay tuned for updates
as we have them!</p>
