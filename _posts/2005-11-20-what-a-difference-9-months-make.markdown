I thought this might be a fun way to update the ol’ belly photo. Here I am, in
all of my glory, at 38 weeks.

Compare this to the Anna of [nine months ago][1], and see what havoc our Wee
one has wreaked on yours truly!

Also, note my distinct lack of creative ambition. This is **not** a hat and
scarf that I made, but I’d like to get back into the swing (or knit, if you
will) of things once the Bean has arrived, any day now…

If the weather continues to be as cold as it has been, we will also need warm
woolen garments, and things to do indoors only!
