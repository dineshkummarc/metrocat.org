You know you're an adult when...

You receive money as a gift and you use it to buy <b>SOCKS</b>! They are very cool socks, which can be seen <a href="http://www.littlemissmatched.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.lifeisgood.com/StorePlus/Store/Coolsocks.asp">here</a>. At least it would appear that I am still a child in some ways.

Whatever will <i>my child</i> think of her crazy mama. I'm sure I'll find out in months (and years) to come.
