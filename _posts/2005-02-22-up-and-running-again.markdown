Well, it took much longer than expected, but I've finally managed to get us switched over to [the new hosting company](http://www.hostexcellence.com/). I certainly hope they're better than the old one. Although, for only $3 per month, I can put up with quite a bit.

I hope to redesign the site in the coming weeks based on some ideas I had while reading [Joshua Porter's Web site](http://www.bokardo.com/). Josh got me thinking about how the static nature of our Web site might benefit from the work that's going on with [Folksonomies](http://www.bokardo.com/archives/change_is_good/index.php). I'm not certain I'll be able to act on my ideas without going over to PHP, which seems like more work than I'm willing to put into it, but it will be nice to fiddle around again.
