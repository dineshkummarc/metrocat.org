So I've listened to my first Podcast. Hooray! On the one hand, it was interesting listening to Jason Fried talking about building [BaseCamp](http://www.basecamphq.com). But I still think I would have enjoyed reading about it more.

Granted, I was able to work on some other stuff while listening, but I'm not certain that was a good thing: I doubt I absorbed the entire message Jason was trying to deliver and I doubt I gave my other work enough attention.

Now if I had to commute by bus or train, IT conversations would be wonderful. I'm not certain how useful they are for me right now. Maybe I'll try burning some onto CD and play them in the car on my way to work.
