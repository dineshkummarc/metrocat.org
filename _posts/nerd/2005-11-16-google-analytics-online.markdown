Well, it looks like Google has finally started feeding data into [Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/).

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to support Safari.

That's annoying. I suppose I'll fire up Firefox and see how newburyportion.com is doing.

**Update**: As of this morning (17 Nov), I can't get into Google Analytics using Firefox. The moment after I log in, I get redirected to the search page. Granted, I'm now logged in, but I can't see the Analytics control panel. Ah, growing pains. Even *really* big companies have them.
