I just finished reading an [interesting article in the NY Times about the problems plaguing Dell Computer](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/technology/13computer.html?pagewanted=all). The article makes a big deal about HP's new [The Computer Is Personal Again campaign](http://www.hp.com/personalagain/us/en/index.html?mtxs=home-hho&mtxb=B1&mtxl=L1), so I thought I'd check out the laptop offerings from HP.

No. I'm not in the market for a new PC laptop. My employer is a loyal DuLL buyer so I work on the latest in boring grey plastic laptops. But it can't hurt to see what the other side of the OS divide is using, can it?

It really can.

For example, [the HP Compaq nc8230 Notebook PC](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF25a/321957-64295-89315-321838-f1-447338.html) offers displays with the following characteristics:

* 15.4-inch TFT WXGA,
* 15.4-inch TFT WSXGA+ Wide Viewing Angle or
* 15.4-inch TFT WUXGA Wide-Viewing Angle

Does anyone know what this means?

Compare this with the display offered on the new [15" MacBook Pro](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wo/0.RSLID?mco=608880DF&nclm=MacBookPro):

* 15.4-inch widescreen display 1440x900 resolution

(**Note:** Exact wording was copied and pasted from the respective companies' online stores.)

Even the names of the HP laptops are sinister sounding: HP Compaq nc8230, HP Compaq nw8240, HP Compaq nw8440 or HP Compaq Presario V4000T. Where do these companies come up with these names? Who can possibly feel loyal to his *nw8440*? Who wouldn't switch to an *nw8550* or even an *nw8640+* should one come along?

When was the last time you heard someone say: "I love my nw8440!"

On the other hand, when was the last time you heard someone say: "I love my PowerBook!"
