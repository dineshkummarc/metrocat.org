It's now official: <i>I've been offered a position as part of the UI team for the Apple online store.</i>

Naturally, I've accepted.

Of course, this means we have to move _again_. Fortunately, I have a very patient wife... I'll be scouting apartments down in Los Gatos, Campbell, and Mountain View. Basically, towns that have a town rather than just apartments and strip malls.

This only postpones my learning about Cocoa -- my _day_ job will still be hard-core JavaScript, CSS, and HTML -- but I'll have to find out what the policies are regarding blogging. The _last_ thing I want to do is get booted out.
