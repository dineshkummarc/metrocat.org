I think this is ironic:

<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/11/22/what-is-spyware.html"><img src="http://newburyportion.com/photos/111-what_is_spyware.gif" height="91" width="111" alt="O'Reilly features an article about spyware"/></a>
</p>

**Notice:** It says "Windows" not "Macintosh" on the label.

Have you ever heard of spyware for the Mac?
