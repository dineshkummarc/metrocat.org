title: Why Buy From Apple?

Several people have questioned my policy of buying all my Apple equipment directly from the Apple store (whether in person or by mail). I might be able to get a better deal from Amazon or someone else if I shopped around.

But there are advantages to purchasing from Apple.

Three weeks ago, my Airport Express arrived. I took it out of the box, plugged it in and configured it. I used it for about an hour (streaming Jazz from my favourite radio station [KPLU](http://kplu.org)) before going to bed.

The next day was recycling day. My first task upon coming home from work was to take all the recycling out (boxes, cans, plastic jugs, etc.). This included the box from the Airport Express. When I was through, I sat down and tried streaming some Jazz.

No luck. The Airport Express simply didn't want to work. It was basically DOA.

This afternoon, I finally was able to get away from my tasks as a new father to return the Airport Express (as well as buy a new battery and power supply for my wife's 12" PowerBook G4). The Genius at the Apple store was sorry that I'd received a defective Airport Express. I explained that I didn't have the original box, but he said not to worry. After a little twiddling with the computer, he pulled a new box off the shelf, opened it, and swapped Airport Expresses. The dud went back to Apple and I walked out with a new Airport Express (which works great).

No questions. No hassle. No problem.
