title: When Is A Beta Not a Beta?

Reading the news this morning, I ran across the following statement:

>  It's very early in development but there's a beta available if you'd like to try it.

Based on my background of hard-core product development, this seems a little bit contradictory to me. I always understood a Beta to be a feature complete product that's only lacking a little polish and a *lot* of testing.

From the Wikipedia page on [Development Stages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_stage):

>  Each major version of a product usually goes through a stage when new features are added (alpha stage), then a stage when it is actively debugged (beta stage), and finally a stage when all important bugs have been removed (stable stage).

This completely agrees with my understanding of development stages. So by this definition, the previous "news" statement should read:

> It's very early in development but there's a pre-alpha available if you'd like to try it.

Granted, in the days when Google leaves a product in Beta for 2.5 million years, the whole notion of what's a Beta can get a little confusing. But I don't think anyone *really* disputes that a Beta *should* be feature complete. You may find a few must have features during the beta-test cycle, in which case you *might* have a second Beta cycle or you might postpone those features for a point release (depending on your cash-flow really).

But the attitude for a Beta should be: "If no one finds any bugs, we ship it."
