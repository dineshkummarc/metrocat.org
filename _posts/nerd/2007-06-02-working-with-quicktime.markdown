Lately, I've been working with QuickTime quite a bit. And while it's amazingly cool to have movies embedded into a page. There are some real tricks and caveats to keep in mind.

Once thing have settled down, I'm going to write up what I've learned about making QuickTime work in all the browsers &mdash; meaning Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. And share some clever tricks you can use to make QuickTime a more seemless part of your Web experience.

Stay tuned.
