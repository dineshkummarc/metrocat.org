I read a post about [running Mac OS X apps on Linux](http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/30/0230204) on Slashdot this morning:

>I have the urge to commit my 24" Core 2 Duo iMac to a single Linux operating system, thus giving up the goodness of my beloved Mac OS X. I am not a stranger to Linux, but I am a stranger to running Mac apps on Linux. On my PowerPC I can use SheepShaver to run Classic apps. The Mac-on-Linux project can run OS X apps, but it requires a PowerPC, not an x86. Virtualizing and emulating are inefficient, especially given the wonderful results the WINE project has had in getting Windows apps to run on Linux. What I would like is an equivalent: a software compatibility layer that will allow Linux to run Mac OS X apps at native performance. I believe there is some additional complexity in accomplishing this. Mac OS X apps aren't just Mac OS X apps. They are Carbon. They are Cocoa. They are universal binaries. They are PPC code with Altivec. Does such a project exist yet? If not, why not?

Here's an idea for the Linux Army: How about writing applications that don't suck?

Every time I read about someone running Windows apps on Linux, it reinforces the impression I have of Linux: the applications must _really_ suck if you _want_ to run Windows apps.

And now they're starting with Mac apps.

Maybe if you Linux folks could get your collective heads out of your asses, learn a thing or two about decent UI design, stop arguing about whether Gnome is better than KDE, and sit down and code, you _might_ come up with an app as good as Delicious Library, Coda, iPhoto, or any of the many excellent Mac applications. But who am I kidding? Once you realise that none of your Linux buddies are willing to pay for your work, you'll quit just short of version 1.0 -- just like every other Linux application.
