In his recent post, [Wil Shipley lays down the gauntlet](http://wilshipley.com/blog/2006/07/note-to-bill-gates-ill-take-your-bet.html) and bets Bill Gates $10,000 that Microsoft will be unable to ship Windows Vista on time (AKA January, which is actually much later than it was originally scheduled to ship).

How I'd love to see Gates take up this challenge. Of course, it would be _best_ if Shipley won.
