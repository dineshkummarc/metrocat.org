Yesterday, Apple announced the new MacBook Air. As I was reading the specs for it, I thought this would have been the _perfect_ machine for me back when I commuted to Manhattan by ferry or Path train. Or even when I travelled frequently to give JavaScript training classes.

I simply can't believe people are complaining about this marvellous device, but [Wil definitely hits the nail on the head in his latest post about the Air](http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/01/macbook-air-haters-suck-my-dick.html):

>Some journalists get so close to the truth it hurts, yet miss the large print. "OMG! The unit is all sealed and self-contained like the iPod!"

>Yes... the iPod. That huge failure. Also, the iPhone. Stunning disappointment that it was. I mean, jeebus, why would Apple make ANOTHER device incredibly simple? Clearly the market has spoken, and it wants tons of ports and screws and geegaws and flippers... no, wait, no it doesn't.

I almost want to start traveling again just so I can have an excuse to buy one.
