Derek Powazek, senior designer for Technorati and all around clever guy, has hit the nail on the head regarding [the value of the bottom of the page](http://www.powazek.com/2005/09/000540.html):

>In this business, a user that actually reads all the way to the bottom of a page is like gold. They're your best, most engaged, happiest users. You know, because they haven't clicked away. They did the best possible thing they could do, and now they're at the bottom of the page. And how do you reward them?

I've often felt annoyed by having to scroll back up the page after reading a long involved article. More often than not, I've just clicked the bookmark view toggle and browsed off to another site.

It's a shame I just finished redesigning our Web site. Now I have the urge to do it all over again.
