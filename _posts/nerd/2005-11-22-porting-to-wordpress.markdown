Now that I've decided to switch to WordPress (yes, Josh, I know you're so happy), I need to figure out how I'm going to organise the site.

Currently, newburyportion is set up as three separate weblogs using Movable Type: the journal, nerd, and our photography site. This was made necessary by limitations of Movable Type, but now that things are set up that way, I'm inclined to leave it.

I suppose I could use three separate installations of WordPress, but that seems wasteful.

Is there anything similar to TextPattern's sections within WordPress? Is it possible to have more than one blog?

And are there any decent photo gallery plugins?

Help?
