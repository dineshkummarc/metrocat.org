In a recent article on his Web site, [Derek Powazek recommends embracing the bottom of the page](http://www.powazek.com/2005/09/000540.html). I've whipped up a redesigned version of this site taking these ideas to heart.

<a class="figure" href="http://newburyportion.com/photos/bottom-based-design.gif"><img src="http://newburyportion.com/photos/bottom-based-design-thumb.gif" width="150" height="150" alt="A redesign of newburyportion that embraces the bottom of the page"/></a>

I'm afraid I've plagiarised a little too freely: I doubt anyone would really want to send us anything by snail-mail. And I had to work in what's becoming the trademark of newburyportion: the Ajaxy search.

All in all, I *really* like it. I like it better than the current design.

Were I to replace the current design, that would make an all-time record for shortest design lifetime of any site I've built. Hmm... tempting.
