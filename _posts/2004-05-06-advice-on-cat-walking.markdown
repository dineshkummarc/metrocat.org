<p>Perhaps I've already told you that <a

to go walking on a leash. Perhaps you've lain awake at night wondering
how I convinced a cat to accept a harness and leash. Well, your nights
of sleeplessness are at an end.</p>
<p>You'll want the following ingredients:</p>

    <dd>This is the best harness I've found yet. We've tried a couple
    and this one is easy to put on and really doesn't seem to annoy
    Augustus at all.</dd>

    <dt>Retractable Lead</dt>
    <dd>Augustus doesn't like a woven nylon leash because it actually
    weighs something and he feels like he's <i>restrained</i>. However
    a retractable lead uses a thin nylon string which seems to weigh
    almost nothing (plus it's longer). You can get a good <a

<p>Of course, having all this equipment is great; but it won't make
your cat <i>like</i> walking on a leash. In the past, numerous people
have weighed in with their advice on helping a cat acclimate to a
harness: all of it turned out to be bunk. The least accurate was, "Put
the harness on him while he's in the house and let him wear it for a
while to get comfortable with it." I can tell you first hand, he'll
never grow comfortable wearing a harness. He's a bloody cat and cat's
don't wear harnesses.</p>
<p>The approach I took with Augustus was to put the harness on him,
attach the leash, pick him up and carry him outside and plop him down
in the middle of the lawn. Suddenly, he really wasn't thinking about
the harness or leash, because there were squirrels and birds that had
his undivided attention. I did learn to play out all the string on the
lead and lock it to give him the greatest feeling of freedom.</p>
<p>Now all is well: Augustus lays down when I grab the harness and
leash and even rolls over to let me fasten the harness easier. I doubt
he really likes either the harness or the leash; but he definitely
likes what they allow him to do...</p>
