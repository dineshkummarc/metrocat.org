So, I've changed my mind. I believe I have determined ten things I can actually accomplish.

Each day, I resolve:

1. To learn something new. Having a child should make that easy.

2. To <i>try</i> something new, especially something at which I might fail.

3. To meet someone new and learn their name. Animals count, as well as people.

4. To do something especially good (and preferably unexpected) for someone else. For friends and family, and also for strangers.

5. To do something nice for myself.

6. To do or make something that makes the world a better, or least more interesting, place.

7. To laugh, or at least smile, once a day.

8. To have at least 5 minutes of quiet time each day.

9. To say "thank you" at least once a day.

10. To forgive myself for not doing everything on this list, and to praise myself for the things I did do!

And I have three more for good measure:

11. To spend more than 5 minutes outdoors, admiring the wonders of nature.

12. To pet each of my kitties. With the excitement of the new baby, I must admit I have not been very attentive.

13. To tell my daughter and husband that I love them at least once a day.
