Has anyone else noted the irony?

Looking at the anarchy that is the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it occurred to me today that if they weren't off getting killed in Iraq, we'd have a heck of a lot more National Guardsmen to help out in New Orleans...

I'm not the praying sort these days, but I am certainly sending out a plea for those who need help right now.
