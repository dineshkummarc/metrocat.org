<p>As "They" say, the show must go on...</p>
<p>This week has been difficult. I have remained strong, even with the
loss of my grandmother (7/25), and the near-loss (due to fire) of my
apartment due to fire last weekend (7/26). Maybe it was these factors,
or maybe it was due to my colleagues' lack of sympathy/interest in
anything related to themselves and/or the movie, but by the end of the
week I had begun to lose heart. </p>
<p>I still adore movies, but I do not love the process of making them.
And I wonder if I, as an independent-minded and sensitive human being,
have any place in the film industry. It is a selfish business, and I
have made many efforts in recent years to become less of a selfish
human being.  I will most certainly continue on this project, and will
attempt to find film/television related work after this, but the gears
are already turning as I search for something that is both creative and
compassionate.</p>
<p>The movie itself moves along. A few crew members have left (whether
or not of their own accord I will not say), and others have taken their
place. Two more weeks before this madness is over. I certainly hope it
will all be worthwhile. It continues to be a learning process for
all...</p>
