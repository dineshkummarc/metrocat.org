<p>My buddy Ken has recommended I read <u>What Color Is Your
Parachute?</u> -- the classic job-hunting manual. It's particularly
good, I'm finding, not because Bolles (the author) has any new insights
into the job hunting process, but because he states the obvious in the
sort of way that it can't be ignored.</p>
<p>Now, all I need to do is <i>apply</i> the lessons learned from
reading this book; and I should be able to take over the world, er, get
a great job.</p>
