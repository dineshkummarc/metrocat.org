There's a new-ish restaurant in town, [Phoenix Rising][1]. They serve
traditional comfort foods like burgers, mac-n-cheese, pastas, etc. But two
things make them stand out:

* Most of their ingredients come from local farms.
* They offer a 4 oz burger along with the more popular 8 oz burger.

For someone like me who simply can't finish a burger at most restaurants, this is a wonderful feature. Most of the time I must either choose to leave half my burger uneaten or over eat and feel sick. Phoenix now gives me another choice. That's really great.

They also offer a broad enough menu that almost anyone we take to dinner will find something to eat. I'm always a little cautious about restaurants with an overly wide selection, because I don't think they can do everything good. On the other hand, comfort food doesn't require a culinary genius.
