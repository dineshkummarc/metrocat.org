There's a new-ish restaurant in town, <a
href="http://www.phoenixrhinebeck.com">Phoenix Rising</a>. They serve
traditional comfort foods like burgers, mac-n-cheese, pastas, etc. But
two things make them stand out:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Most of their ingredients come from local farms.</li>
	<li>They offer a 4 oz burger along with the more popular 8 oz
	burger.</li>
</ol>
<p>For someone like me who simply can't finish a burger at most
restaurants, this is a wonderful feature. Most of the time I must
either choose to leave half my burger uneaten or over eat and feel
sick. Phoenix now gives me another choice. That's really great.</p>
<p>They also offer a broad enough menu that almost anyone we take to
dinner will find something to eat. I'm always a little cautious about
restaurants with an overly wide selection, because I don't think they
can do everything good. On the other hand, comfort food doesn't require
a culinary genius.</p>
