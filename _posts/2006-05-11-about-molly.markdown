Molly is our "Sunshine". There is something magical about the twinkle in those dark brown eyes, which apparently has us under some sort of spell. Nothing else could explain why we fail to sell her to pirates each and every time she gets up to mischief, or has a huge tantrum. Of course, no one in the outside world knows she is anything other than a perfect little girl...
