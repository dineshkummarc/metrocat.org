<p>I have decided to try a different format for my resolutions this
year, although in reality it will probably end up as the same laundry
list of things I would like to accomplish and/or modify.</p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<blockquote>
	I resolve to better myself, both as an individual and as an
	aspiring mother, through the development of aspects of my mind,
	body, and spirit. It is my overall goal that through these personal
	achievements, I am able to make a significant and meaningful
	contribution to the world at large.
</blockquote>
<p>I also hope that by breaking the resolution into 3 categories (with
approximately 5-10 resolutions each) that I will be better able to
express and organize my goals, and therefore maybe accomplish more in
2005.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the actual list of "mini-resolutions"- coming to a
blog near you!</p>
