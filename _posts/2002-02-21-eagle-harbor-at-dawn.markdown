Perhaps the most common exhortation in the world of photography is to capture
the warm light and long shadows prevalent at dusk and dawn. So much has been
written about the glorious images captured during these two magical moments that
one can't help being infected with a curious enthusiasm for waking up long
before the newspaper is delivered and sweating out to some scenic locale just to
take a few photographs. In the last thirty years, I've only witnessed a handful
of sunrises; so, I resolved to turn over a new leaf and become a dawn
photographer.

It's a bit harder to capture the sunrise than I anticipated. Because I'm still
trying to determine which legs I like best, I had to arrange to borrow a tripod.
After preparing my digital film, packing my bag and charging my batteries, I was
all set to go. All I had to do was get out of bed when the alarm sounded at 5
O'clock. After two false starts, I was on my way.

Eagle Harbor hosts Bainbridge Island's ferry terminal, the sun had finally risen
over the horizon and lit up one of Washington State's many ferries.

I'd selected Eagle Harbor on Bainbridge Island for my first sunrise expedition.
Practicality factored heavily into the decision: the forecast indicated rain all
weekend; so, my only chance was to catch the sun before the rain arrived with
the weekend. Therefore, any location had to be nearby so I wouldn't miss a full
day of work. Eagle Harbor is accessible via ferry from downtown Seattle where I
live, and is one of my favourite summer-time destinations because quaint little
buildings line the waterfront and bobbing sail boats fill the harbour. How could
I go wrong with such a scenic location?

This boardwalk runs along the waterfront and connects with the many
docks jutting out into the harbour. This early in the morning it is
still covered with frost.

The first ferry from Seattle leaves at 6:20 am and arrives in Eagle Harbor
around 6:55 am. Unfortunately, some joker had scheduled sunrise for 7:20 am. By
the time the ferry docked, the sky already had a peach and amber glow; and I was
still a half mile or more from the marina where I planned capture the sunrise.
The last time I'd visited Eagle Harbor was in June of the last year -- a whole
nine months ago. I'd admired the harbour and the restful atmosphere; but, I
hadn't spent enough time learning my way around. Now, when every moment meant a
missed opportunity, I was eager to get into position and start shooting. The
moment I found an acceptable location, I dashed out onto the dock, set up my
tripod and started shooting. Possessed of an urge to shoot, I didn't pay much
attention to what I was shooting. I just shot.

These two row boats caught my eye. It looks like they've seen a lot of harsh use
over the years.

The sun soon climbed high enough that I could no longer take pictures facing
east. I decided to wander around a bit; perhaps I'd run across something that
would catch my attention. Almost immediately I stumbled upon the wonderful,
sensuous line of the waterfront boardwalk as it curved along the shore. Early
morning frost still covered its wooden treads and the whole structure reflected
gloriously in the still water below. A few yards along the boardwalk I spied a
solitary sailboat anchored in the center of the harbour enjoying its own private
dawn. And finally, just as I was running out of film, two elderly row boats
napping before their early morning swim.

Dawn came to this sailboat a little later than to the rest of the harbour. I'm
certain this was just so I could get in place and photograph it.

I learned quite a bit from my early morning escapade. Yes, the quality of dawn
light is worth making an effort to capture; but, I had already accepted this as
true and had only wanted confirmation. What surprised me most was that in spite
of my inadequate planning, I managed to get any decent photographs at all. Not
one of the shots taken before I gave up on the sunrise was worth a damn. But all
of the photographs after the actual dawn were keepers. Obviously, when planning
future trips, I must include an advance visit to the location with an eye
focussed on photograph-worthy subject material. Furthermore, it's obvious that
getting in position well before sunrise is also critical to success of an early
morning shoot.
