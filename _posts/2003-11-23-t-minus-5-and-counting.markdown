As incredible as it is to believe, we are now <b>less than one week</b> before the Wedding of the Year (at least in the Watkins/Piskoz family circles).

Nearly all of the details are set, with the possible exception of dry cleaning my coat. Although, by the looks of the weather forecast (high of 51, low of 38- for those of you who are keeping score), I might be dressed a little more warmly than I need to if I actually wear it.

We even picked up our Carvel ice cream cakes last night. I couldn't help but giggle at the thought of buying my wedding cake at the "ghetto grocery" (a story for another time, believe me).

I am very excited, but I'm certain my excitement will increase even more once I have completed the next two grueling days of work.

We also have to plan and survive Thanksgiving out and about in Jersey City...
