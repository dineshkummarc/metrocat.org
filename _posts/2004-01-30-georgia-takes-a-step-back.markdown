<p>I can't believe this. My former home, the State of Georgia, is
currently embroiled in controversy over whether to teach alternative
<i>theories</i> regarding the origins of life on Earth. This is just
ludicrous.</p>

	<p>"Creation is not science, so it should not be taught in science
	class," said Dr. Ayala, a professor of genetics at the University
	of California at Irvine. "We don't teach astrology instead of
	astronomy or witchcraft practices instead of medicine."</p>

<p>This is from a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">NY Times</a>
article entitled <a

Takes on 'Evolution'</a>. These people are <i>serious</i>; however,
they need to take time out from thumping their bibles and look at the
world around them. Really look at some fossils. Really look at some
evolutionary evidence.</p>
<p>Of course, the crux of the issue is that they're embarrassed to be
related to apes.</p>
