<p>Well folks, some of you have just lost some money, I imagine.
Scruffy and I will celebrate our 2-month anniversary of wedded *cough*
bliss this evening with a meal at our favorite restaurant. </p>
<p>I must admit, with the snow and whatnot, it has been difficult to
focus on the happy things happening for us recently. Hopefully a night
like this will help us remember how fortunate we each are to have found
someone (to put up with us)!</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, it would appear that my husband has
been monopolizing this blog. I suppose I must do something about
that.</p>
