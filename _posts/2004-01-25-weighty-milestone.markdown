Way back in May or June of last year, Anna expressed a complete lack of desire to walk down the aisle beside a fatty. Thus began our weight loss program.

Anna signed us both up for the online version of Weight Watchers -- since neither of us is big on the idea of going to meetings where a dozen overweight people lament that they just can't take off the pounds. Initially, it was quite a struggle to change the way I ate. But now, I am able to keep better track of what I'm eating and estimate the <i>costs</i> of meals eaten in restaurants.

Against the advice of the Weight Watchers folks, I weigh myself at night and in the morning -- although I frequently forget one or both. This really helps me keep a handle on my eating, because some days I just can't stay on the plan. Seeing that I've gained a bit of weight really helps me stick to the plan the next and subsequent days.

So, imagine my delight when last night I weighed in at 198.6 lbs.

I can still remember the first time I stepped on a scale and discovered I weighed more than 200 lbs. Ok, I can <i>vaguely</i> remember it. That day was more than a decade ago.

For the last month or so, I've been teetering on the edge of 200 lbs. In the evening I'd be 200.6 or 201.4 or similar. And in the morning: 199.4 or possibly even 198.8. So basically, I weighed 200 lbs.

This is the first time in more than 10 years that I can honestly say I weigh less than 200 lbs.

Of course, I must really thank my darling (although frequently cranky) wife for helping me -- just knock off the damn fruit pies already!
