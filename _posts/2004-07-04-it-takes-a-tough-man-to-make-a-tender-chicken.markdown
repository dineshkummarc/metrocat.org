In August, 2002, I spent a week at [The Maine Photographic Workshops][1]
learning how to make better photographs.

One afternoon, my class went to [the Union Fair][2], which in addition to
having a wonderful assortment of interesting people offered really incredible
edibles made from local blueberries.

This fellow was presiding over his prize winning roosters. They really didn’t
look anything like a rooster to me, because they were simply too pretty. After
chatting with him for a while, I asked him whether I might photograph him and
he was kind enough to permit me. He’d been quite friendly and had a reasonably
ready smile, so I was surprised to find him so stern when I made the
photograph.
