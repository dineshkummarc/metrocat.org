This morning, Anna and I went for a hike along the Delaware River.
Starting at Bull Island State Park and ending roughly at Stockton, NJ.
The total, round-trip distance is 6 miles. It's an easy trail; but
there really isn't much to see. Across the pedestrian bridge, in
Pennsylvania is a nice little deli where we picked up a sandwich and a
huge slab of watermelon for a picnic lunch at the Old Mill in
Stockton.

I can, however, recommend the route we took there and back: I-78 out
of Hell (AKA Jersey City) to County Road 513 south to Rt 29. Then pick
up County Road 523 north at Stockton back to I-78. Of course, then we
had to go back home to Hell.
