<p>I don't know what it is with me these days. I just can't seem to
find anything particularly interesting or clever to write about.</p>
<p>I do absolutely adore Rhinebeck- all of the little shops, a million
(or less) places to hike, the close proximity to my folks. </p>
<p>I just feel like something is missing, some small part of me was
lost in the move. When I find it, you'll be the second or third to
know.</p>
