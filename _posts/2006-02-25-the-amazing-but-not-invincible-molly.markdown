It is incredible to believe, but our little girl is nearly three months old! I felt the need to write this update a wee bit early, as this week and next Jeff and I will each undergo surgery. Jeff is having his deviated septum repaired (or further destroyed, I don't quite understand the details), and I will be having six teeth removed (including two wisdom teeth) in preparation for having braces installed.

But I digress... (and by the way, can you tell how much I love parentheses?)

This month, Molly has learned to roll over both ways, tried to sit up on her own from an inclined position, and grabbed things in her hands. Like her mother as a child, Miss Molly doesn't like to take naps during the day, although she had been sleeping about 9 hours/night (one 4-6 chunk, and two 2-3 hour blocks.) She was starting to mellow, if only just a little.

Then it happened.

Our Molly got sick.

She had been acting more clingy, and eating every two hours, even waking during the night to do so. Not fun for either of us. 

She was diagnosed with an ear infection. Probably the result of a virus.

Fortunately, she has not lost weight. In fact, she has gained to 12lbs, 13 oz. And her condition improves with each passing day.

Unfortunately, she has had multiple days of liquid explosiveness from her posterior. And she still has six days of yucky pink bubblegum antibiotics to swallow, twice a day. Poor, poor baby!
