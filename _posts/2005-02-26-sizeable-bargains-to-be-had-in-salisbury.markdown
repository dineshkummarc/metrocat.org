On Fridays, I volunteer with the wonderful Merrimac River Feline Rescue Society (aka <a href="http://www.mrfrs.org/">MRFRS</a>) in Salisbury, MA. But that's a story for another post.

Whilst in Salisbury, I have consistently passed a sign for <a href="http://www.arlenesofsalisbury.com/index.htm">this</a> fine establishment. It isn't clear from their website, but it comforts me to know that should I ever expand 50 or more clothing sizes, they will be able to accommodate me. In fact, they have clothing up to size 60.

60?!

I am speechless.
