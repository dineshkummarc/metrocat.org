In addition to moving from [Movable Type](http://sixapart.com/movabletype) to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), I've redesigned the site (yet again). The current design is heavily inspired by [Derek Powazek's Web site](http://powazek.com) which features the majority of all navigation at the bottom of the page. I'm going to try this layout for a while to see how it works for me.

I've very pleased with the way things look in Safari (an [ACID 2](http://www.webstandards.org/act/acid2/) compliant browser), however, I didn't do sufficient testing using FireFox and as a result, not everything renders correctly.

In addition, the theme system in WordPress forces me to break my pages up into chunks, and I tried to build the design in the chunks rather than as a single page which I later chopped up.

So let's call this the *Newburyportion open Beta*. Things are guaranteed to change a bit before the *final* release...
