<p>So here I am, resting (as is the rest of the company) after
completing Week One of production. And what a week it was... I cannot
reveal all of the details- partly because I do not know all of the
details, and partly because I think I would like to continue to work in
the "biz" and do not want to say the wrong things about the wrong
people.</p>
<p>But, needless to say, there are personality conflicts in any setting
and any industry, and the tighter the quarters, the more readily these
conflicts come to a head. On a small budget movie, being shot in
smaller apartments, it was only a matter of time before someone made a
mistake and got themselves fired.</p>
<p>I have been running around more than I ever have in my entire life.
And when I say running, I mean <b>literally</b>.  I added it up, and on
one day alone (a 15-hour day I might add), I spent nearly 150 minutes
speed-walking/running between errands. Whew! </p>
<p>I hate to admit it, but I might be getting too old for this s---,
er, stuff.</p>
