If I were to choose one word to describe life with Molly, it would be <i>unpredictable</i>. From day to day, I never know what to expect. Sure, you say, it's like that with all children. But with Molly, it's a hundred times more intense, because <i>she</i> is that much more intense.

After four months, however, I am finally starting to figure out Molly's colic. I always thought it was one thing that caused her to shriek at the top of her voice, usually her stomach. Well, I was wrong. It's never just one thing. She's actually very tolerant of one source of discomfort or irritation, and perhaps even two or three. But at some point, she's had enough. Up until now, I was only noticing (and trying to fix) that one thing, without any success.

Now, I just work my way through the following (choose any combination):

<ul>
<li>too hot/too cold</li>
<li>bored/overstimulated</li>
<li>surroundings too noisy/too quiet</li>
<li>too much motion/too still</li>
<li>hungry/too full</li>
<li>full diaper/unable to create full diaper (of #2)</li>
<li>regurgitation (with or without heartburn)</li>
<li>hat or other clothing annoying her</li>
<li>hit herself in head with toy or otherwise physically injured herself</li>
<li>startled or frightened</li>
</ul>

She has also recently added another variable:

<ul>
<li><b>teething!</b></li>
</ul>

Every parent has to play this guessing game. Not every parent has a child that punishes them for the wrong choice by trying to render them deaf. And she doesn't stop until you get it right.

Now that's what I call "fun".
