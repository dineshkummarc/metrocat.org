<p>I continue to be deeply saddened by the recent tragedy in Southeast
Asia. I have donated what I can spare at the moment, and am planning to
donate more as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p>Certainly, as an individual I feel helpless to do anything of
significance. But it my hope that by example, and through
encouragement, we can gather in numbers and hopefully make something of
a difference.</p>
<p>Saving one life is worth it, even if we cannot save them all.</p>
