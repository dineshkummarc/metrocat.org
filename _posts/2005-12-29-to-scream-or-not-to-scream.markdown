Sometimes I can fix whatever is making Molly scream. Sometimes her diaper needs to be changed. Sometimes she's hungry. Sometimes her pacifier has become lost.

But sometimes, nothing I do can possibly make her happy. Yes, I can *interrupt* her screaming. But really, what's the point of that? We get 30 seconds to a full minute of peace before Mount Molly erupts again.

So if nothing I do has any effect, why should I do anything at all?
