In case some of you missed it (and shame on you if you did), last Sunday was Mother's Day. As is sometimes usual, I was feeling a bit sorry for myself. Jeff had gone off to work for a few hours, and Miss Molly and I were finding entertainment where we could. I had purchased new pants and a shirt, sadly necessitated by an increase in girth, and was trying them on at home. I asked Molly what she thought of my new outfit. 

She looked me up and down, her eyes intense. This is usually not a good thing. At two, she has not learned that sometimes honesty can be stretched a little in order to spare one's feelings.

Instead, she surprised and delighted me by saying, "Your new outfit is <em>beautiful</em>."

Update: Yesterday, while out shopping, I placed her in an cart and she declared, "This cart is <em>beautiful</em>." Apparently orange carts and yours truly rate equally in the eyes of a toddler.
