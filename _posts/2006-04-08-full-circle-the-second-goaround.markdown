Since last I posted, we've had some interesting updates on the Molly tummy front.

First, we (read: **I**) took Molly off the Zantac. It was becoming increasingly difficult to get her to swallow, rather than wear, the medicine. She would fight me when I even approached her with the syringe, and scream immediately thereafter for quite a while. She had also developed insomnia, although I still don't know if it was directly related to or just complicated by the medicine.

Molly seemed fine for a day or two, and then began spitting up. A lot. More like vomiting.

Again, I don't know if it was related to the medicine or not. I do know the night before it began I had an enormous amount of caffeine the night before it began. That may have triggered a reflux reaction, and without the Zantac, the reflux became severe in nature.

We went back to the pediatrician, who referred us to a gastroenterologist, who put Molly on Prilosec. The advantages? This medicine only has to be taken _once_ a day, instead of _three_ times. The disadvantage? Molly once again has insomnia (she was getting better, aside from the vomiting, in the week in between medicines). I have attempted to change the time of day that we give her the medicine, in hopes that this will change this side effect.

If not, we will have to return sooner than planned to the gastroenterologist.

Make the madness stop!

Have I mentioned how cute she is, though? More about that in future posts...
