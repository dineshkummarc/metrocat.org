Or at least less toothy. 

Tomorrow I am having <b><i>SIX</i></b> teeth extracted. Two are the nasty wisdom teeth whose roots have burrowed their way into my sinus cavities, causing me months and months of pain in the form of really painful headaches. Alas, I was not able to have them pulled sooner, as I was preggo. In hindsight, perhaps it was for the best. Maybe the pain they caused distracted me from the pain of labor. Maybe not.

The other four are being removed to pave the way for- BRACES! The first installment will be  on the 23rd of this month, and then my bottom teeth get the treatment in about 6 months.

It's about damn time I get my crazy, crooked teeth straightened. Although I will miss the unique nature of my former smile, I can't wait to see what the new one will look like in a couple of years. I will post pictures of my progress along the way.

The top teeth will have <a href="http://www.3m.com/us/healthcare/unitek/clarity/clarity_braces_or_metal_braces.jhtml">Clarity</a> brackets, so at least they will be a little more subtle. The kids nowadays have no idea how good they have it, with clear braces, and multi-colored retainers. 

Maybe if these things existed sooner, I might have been more serious about the whole teeth straightening thing. Then again, maybe it's because we can find afford for me to have them done.
