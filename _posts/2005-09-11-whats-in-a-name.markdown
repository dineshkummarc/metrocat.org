The [NY Times](http://nytimes.com/) has an article about [women named Katrina and their reaction to the hurricane](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/fashion/sundaystyles/11KAT.html?8hpib).

When I was in College, I hung out with a guy named Andrew. This was right around the time the Miami area was devastated by a nasty hurricane: named Andrew. He plastered the outside of his bedroom door with clippings from various newspapers with headlines like "Andrew decimates South Florida" and "Millions Homeless in the Wake of Andrew's Fury".

Obviously, he wasn't bothered by sharing names with a devastating hurricane.
