<p>Well, both Anna and I are done with work for the week. My family has
all arrived -- Dianne and Joe are staying at the Millennium Hilton
right next to the site of the former World Trade Center, and Mom, Dad,
Bob and Aileen are staying here in Jersey City.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Path finally restored service from Exchange Place (in
Jersey City) to the former World Trade Center. Anna and I will take the
Path train under the Hudson river and walk the three blocks (or so) to
City Hall. There we'll fill out all the paperwork to receive our
license to marry!</p>
