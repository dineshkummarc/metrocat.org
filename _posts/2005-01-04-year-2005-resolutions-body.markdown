I probably shouldn't mention it, for fear of being jinxed, but this is finally going to be the year that Jeff and I open the doors to the Watkins Baby Factory. Perhaps I shouldn't have used the phrase "open the doors", but I'm on a roll now and there's no taking it back.

The plan calls for us to start sometime in June (although we both hope to get in lots of practice before then). That gives me at least six months of pre-baby body. I plan to make the most of it!

And therefore:

> I resolve to get in the best shape of my life. Super-model, super-hero, super-kick-ass-bad-mo-fo shape! I want my skin to glow, my muscles to bulge, my fat to recede, and my teeth to finally be pearly-white (and straight) for a change! I want to learn to look like a woman, and still keep up with the boys. 

I have even managed to locate a company that will make an [ action figure of you][1] if you send them pictures. I will send those pictures, but only six months from now. Or rather, six months from January 15th, which is my arbitrary starting date. So there.
