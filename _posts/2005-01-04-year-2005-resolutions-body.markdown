<p>I probably shouldn't mention it, for fear of being jinxed, but this
is finally going to be the year that Jeff and I open the doors to the
Watkins Baby Factory. Perhaps I shouldn't have used the phrase "open
the doors", but I'm on a roll now and there's no taking it back.</p>
<p>The plan calls for us to start sometime in June (although we both
hope to get in lots of practice before then). That gives me at least
six months of pre-baby body. I plan to make the most of it!</p>
<p>And therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
	I resolve to get in the best shape of my life. Super-model,
	super-hero, super-kick-ass-bad-mo-fo shape! I want my skin to glow,
	my muscles to bulge, my fat to recede, and my teeth to finally be
	pearly-white (and straight) for a change! I want to learn to look
	like a woman, and still keep up with the boys.
</blockquote>
<p>I have even managed to locate a company that will make an <a

action figure of you</a> if you send them pictures. I will send
those pictures, but only six months from now. Or rather, six months
from January 15th, which is my arbitrary starting date. So there.</p>
