<p>I have a confession to make. Ever since my cousin made her
"infamous" announcement (see <a
href="http://metrocat.org/2003/12/26/exciting-news"> Exciting
News</a>), I have been both obsessed with and terrified by the idea of
producing small children.</p>
<p>Jeff seems to be comfortable with the idea of "raising a small crop
of children" as he phrased it in my most recent birthday card. </p>
<p>I am not quite as sold on the idea as I once was. </p>
<p>Granted, I <b>do</b> want children. I just don't think I am as ready
as I thought I was before I started listening to Kim describe morning
sickness and the other 7 to 8 months worth of symptoms that sound like
more like the progression of a horrible disease than the progress
towards a "joyous event".</p>
<p>And don't even get me started on the topic of labor. I have
<b>never</b> been comfortable with the idea of squeezing a little being
the size of a watermelon out an opening that is, well, <i>not</i>
watermelon-sized. But then I started watching Discover Health Channel's
program, <a
href="http://health.discovery.com/schedule/episode.jsp?episode=14&cpi=83354&gid=10652">
Babies: Special Delivery</a> (aka "When Babies Attack" according to
Jeff), which describes all of the things that can go wrong with that
process, and I felt even more apprehensive.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised when our time comes, and it will
be easier than I anticipate. Maybe we'll just adopt. </p>
<p>Maybe I should just stop thinking about it.</p>
