I'll be damned if I can remember the details, but last night's dream combined:

* werewolves
* knitting
* my high school reunion
* wearing a red dress that looked like flames
* Matthew Broderick or Robert Downey, Jr. (I don't recall which)
* three shots of tequila
* frozen Mexican food

Whew. That might explain why I am still so tired.
