I'll be damned if I can remember the details, but last night's dream combined:

<ul>
<li>werewolves</li>
<li>knitting</li>
<li>my high school reunion</li>
<li>wearing a red dress that looked like flames</li>
<li>Matthew Broderick or Robert Downey, Jr. (I don't recall which)</li>
<li>three shots of tequila</li>
<li>frozen Mexican food</li>
</ul>

Whew. That might explain why I am still so tired.
