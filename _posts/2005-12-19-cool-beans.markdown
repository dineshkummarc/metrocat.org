This probably doesn't come as a surprise to anyone, but babies don't like to be cold.

Really. They don't like it.

Last night we tried something new to get The Bean to sleep: we turned up the thermostat to 80Ã‚Â°. Yes, I know that sounds really warm, but for a baby that hasn't got body fat to keep her warm, it's not unreasonable.

With some grub in her tummy, Molly passed out and snored like a contented Sea Monkey.
