According to an article on CNNMoney.com, [Study: CEO pay grows at slower pace in \`05](http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/09/news/economy/ceo_pay/), we should be feeling sorry for the poor CEO:

>The total direct compensation for top corporate CEOs grew by nearly 16 percent last year, a significant increase that was still well below the 41 percent growth of the prior year, according to a survey of 350 major corporations conducted for the Wall Street Journal.

When was the last time **you** got a raise?
