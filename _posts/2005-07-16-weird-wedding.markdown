An ex-boyfriend of mine is getting married today, and I'm feeling a little odd about it.
<!--more-->
Don't get me wrong- I am <i>very</i> happy I am married to the man I am married to, happy to be living where I'm living, <i>deliriously</i> happy to have a Wee one on the way, and sometimes happy about what I am doing with the rest of my life.

But I still have regrets and occasional bitterness.

He is marrying the women he "left" me for. Actually, he never really decided to leave me, I made that decision for him when he told me he wanted to explore "something new". I was very hurt that he had moved 3000 miles to live with me, and once exposed to the world outside our small town, found someone with more money and a flashy car. It was a blow to the ego I did not need, feeling isolated and fragile on the west coast.

Honestly, since getting married I very rarely think about him, and would be happy never to speak to him again.

However, I did think about sending a card. No, not an angry, bitter, ranting card that would reveal to his wife-to-be all of his lying, cheating ways. Okay, I initially thought about it, and then immediately realized I honestly didn't want to anymore. I instead thought about sending a generic "have a happy marriage" card, signed by Jeff and I, showing that I have mostly forgiven him and have moved on with my life.

As he is doing today.

I think he is getting what/who he deserves. Maybe he will be happy in spite of that. I certainly hope so.

Best of luck, Jim buddy. I think you might need it.
