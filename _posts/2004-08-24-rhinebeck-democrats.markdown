While this isn't terribly political, I just wanted to announce the <a href="http://rhinebeckdemocrats.org" title="Rhinebeck Democrats">Rhinebeck Democrats</a> Web site. Some time ago, I volunteered to take over delivery of the Demogram, the monthly newsletter of the Rhinebeck Democratic Committee. I started talking about publishing the newsletter on the Web and things just grew from there.

Please stop by and let me know what you think. I'm trying out the new 3.0 version of <a href="http://movabletype.org">MovableType</a>, a newer version of the same software that runs this site. And I'm impressed with some of the capabilities. Mostly, I've found ways to do things that I've been longing to do here for some time. That probably means I'll be redesigning metrocat.org soon...
