<p>Although I haven't yet updated the outgoing message on my voice
mail, we returned from England Tuesday afternoon. Because of the
numerous legs in our journey, we didn't actually walk through our front
door until 12:30 AM Wednesday morning -- eight hours after our
plane landed.</p>
<p>I'll be uploading the best of our photographs in the next couple
days...</p>
