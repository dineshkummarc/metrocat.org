<p>Well, sorta. This morning after being awakened <i>very</i> early by
the cats and while I was waiting for my morning cup of tea to steep, I
happened to be petting Madeline and looking out our kitchen window when
<b>boink</b> a bluebird landed on the branch just feet from my nose.
Moments later a second bluebird landed next to him. Of course, Madeline
was going ape. <i>Two birds were taunting her!</i></p>
<p>This highlights one of the differences between living in Rhinebeck
and Jersey City. As I recall, there were lots of birds in Jersey City:
pigeons, seagulls, and other aerial rodents. But this is somehow
better.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> my grasp of ornithology is severely limited. That
explains why I mistook a blue jay for a bluebird. It seems they are two
entirely different types of birds. Who knew?</p>
