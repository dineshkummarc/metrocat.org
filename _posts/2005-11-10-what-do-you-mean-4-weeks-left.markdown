Monday marked 36 weeks that the Bean and I have spent together. Although in all fairness, I am the only one who has actually been aware that there are two of us.  Especially whenever one of us kicks me in the spleen.

But soon enough we will be able to look each other in the eye, and see what all of this mother/daughter relationship fuss is about.

Has it really been almost nine months? Am I really going to be a mom? And Jeff a dad?

Wow-wee!

According to the midwife today, however, it doesn't seem that our Wee one is in any hurry to vacate her warm little womb. Somehow that doesn't surprise me. In fact, I am fully expecting history to repeat itself. You see, I was due about the same date our daughter is due, but I arrived nearly two weeks late. Who wants to bet that she will pull the same stunt?

I am actually very sad to think that this crazy pregnancy thing might be over soon. Especially as this first adventure in motherhood will be my last. I'm tired, achy, but I am also madly in love with the little person who is responsible for me feeling this way.

3 Weeks and just a little over 3 days left! And counting...
