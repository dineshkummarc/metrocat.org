Beelzebub himself called to give me the news. In other news [GM chief agrees to halve salary](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4689798.stm), [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk):

>**The chief executive of General Motors (GM) is to take a 50% pay cut to help the struggling carmaker save money.**

>Rick Wagoner and other executives have agreed to reduce their pay and forgo bonuses as part of radical measures aimed at improving GM's finances. 

If I hadn't read it on the Beeb, I probably wouldn't believe it. Of course, lots of other people (you know, the workers) payed a high price first:

>Burdened with massive healthcare and pensions costs, GM has already announced 30,000 job losses and nine factory closures in North America.

So now in a last ditch effort to stay alive, Wagoner and the rest of the fat, overpayed executive "team" will cut their salaries and bonuses. The following just sounds *so* noble:

>No executive directors will receive bonuses for the 2005 financial year

Maybe that would be because they did a terrible job? Nah. Couldn't be.
