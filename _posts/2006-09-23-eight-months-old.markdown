Yes, this post is a little late. Frighteningly, Molly will be 10 months old in two weeks! But, I will do my best to bring everyone up to date before then.

In particular, these past weeks have been difficult. Molly has become much more mobile, and inquisitive- an amusing, but devilish combination.

She certainly keeps us on our toes!

In other news, Molly had her final gastroenterologist visit, and received her final tummy checkup. Based on her eating habits since (more next post), I know that at least those troubles are behind her.

She started to enjoy her swim lessons, just in time for the first session to end. I hope that Jeff can join us in the future, and take some pictures for all to enjoy.

Speaking of pictures to enjoy, I encourage everyone to take a peek at our [flickr][1] account, if you haven't already. I have organized the pictures by month, and will be adding more that don't appear in our posts. Also, you will be able to enjoy the clever comments that Jeff and I make about each photo, and leave your own. 

I wish I had spiffy photos of Molly's first "beauty pageant", in which she participated at the beginning of August, but these are much better:

She saw her eight-month anniversary in with a bang, as she was frightened and then delighted by fireworks, marking the end of the madness known as [Yankee Homecoming][2].

More photos and fun next post....
