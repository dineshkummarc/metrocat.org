<p>Today is the first day I can honestly say I am recovering from the
recent holiday. Quite literally. I had a very nasty upper respiratory
thingy that knocked me on my bottom for a couple of days, including
Christmas. However, unlike the flu, which ordinarily renders the
recipient totally unable to function, I was able to participate in
festivities, albeit in a NyQuil-induced daze. </p>
<p>Man, oh man, that stuff is e-vil! I think they chose that green
color intentionally. I wouldn't be surprised to learn one day that
NyQuil in fact watered-down absinthe. It certainly has some of the same
side effects. I had some <i>crazy</i> dreams...</p>
<p>But, back to Christmas. I received some very cool gifts, including a
new silver <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/">iPod mini</a>
(which I named "Lil Lulu") from my sweetie, as well as some clothes
from <a href="http://www.lifeisgood.com">Life is Good</a>.</p>
<p>And yes, there will be pictures soon enough of the tree, and the
kitties creating holiday havoc.</p>
