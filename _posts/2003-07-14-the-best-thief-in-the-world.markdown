<p>Well, I've finally done it.  I've finally managed to land a position
as a Production Assistant, for a feature film in NYC. Yes, you may
applaud. Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>Granted, it is largely unpaid. And, it is a very small, low-budget
production. But in addition to the traditional servitude associated
with PA work, I have been asked to be the storyboard artist for the
film. In fact, I believe that will be my official credit in the
completed project. </p>
<p>The director, Jacob (Jake) Kornbluth is just a couple of years old
than I, and this is his second feature. The first was <a
href="http://www.haikutunnel.com/">"Haiku Tunnel"</a>, a somewhat
twisted comedy about temping at law firms in San Francisco. As many of
you know, I am more than able to relate.</p>
<p>This project <a
href="http://www.sundancechannel.com/scenes/index.php?ixContent=4063">"
The Best Thief in the World"</a>, is a drama that traces a family's
struggle to hold together in the wake of the father's incapacitating
stroke; at the center is 11-year-old Izzy, an introspective boy who
breaks into other apartments in his building as a way to create a
"safe" imaginative space for himself.  The script was a good, fast
read, which is usually a very good start.</p>
<p>I have spent the past couple of days on location scouts, sketching
possible interior location floorplans and exterior landscapes. They
begin shooting next week, and so everything is increasing in pace and
intensity. I hope we all survive- especially yours truly!</p>
<p>There will be additional updates in the weeks to come...</p>
