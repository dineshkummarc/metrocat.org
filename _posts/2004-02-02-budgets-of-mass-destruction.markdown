<p>In <a
href="http://nytimes.com/2004/02/01/opinion/01FRIE.html?8hpib">Thomas
Friedman's latest editorial</a> for the <a href="http://nytimes.com">NY
Times</a>, he cites Bush's "Budgets of Mass Destruction" (BMDs) as the
real campaign issue on which Democrats should focus.</p>
<blockquote
cite="http://nytimes.com/2004/02/01/opinion/01FRIE.html?8hpib">
	<p>The Bush team's real vulnerability is its B.M.D. -- Budgets
	of Mass Destruction, which have recklessly imperiled the nation's
	future, with crazy tax-cutting and out-of-control spending. The
	latest report from the Congressional Budget Office says the deficit
	is expected to total some $2.4 trillion over the next decade
	-- almost $1 trillion more than the prediction of just five
	months ago. That is a failure of intelligence and common sense that
	threatens to make us all insecure -- and people also feel that
	in their guts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, I do agree with Friedman that Bush is unlikely to face any
repercussions from the WMD issue. That seems abundantly clear now that
Bush is calling for an investigation into the intelligence failure.
Does anyone really expect the investigation to be fair and independent?
Will the investigators be given access to the Administration's internal
documents? Was the 9/11 probe?</p>
<p>No, I think Bush will succeed in evading responsibility for engaging
the United States in an illegal and unjustified war. But I'm certain
there's still plenty of material to get him kicked out of office. When
you get right down to it, what people most care about is themselves and
their family. Bush has clearly imperilled the security of the country
and its citizens with his obscene budgets and tax deferments.</p>
