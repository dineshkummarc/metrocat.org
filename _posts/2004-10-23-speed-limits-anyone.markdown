I don't think drivers pay any attention to the posted speed limit
any more.

I've noticed in my travels that when the speed limit changes, from
say 65 MPH to 55 MPH, most drivers don't bother to slow down at all.
This would be a trifling issue if these drivers were obeying the speed
limit, but in most cases they are exceeding the posted limit by at
least 10 miles per hour. So when the speed limit drops from 65 to 50
MPH around Worcester, MA, these drivers who were doing 75 MPH are now exceeding the limit by **25 MPH**.

This makes for some exceedingly stressful driving for those few of
us who obey the law and never (really, I mean it) exceed the speed
limit.

For example, imagine you're driving along in a Miata at 50 MPH. The
top's down. Vintage Tom Waits playing on the stereo. *Suddenly,
an 18 wheeled monstrosity comes barrelling down on you from behind at
70 to 75 MPH!* In England, these things are aptly called
Juggernauts. What makes this so frightening is the driver will slam on
his compression brakes -- drowning out even Tom's gravelly voice and
rattling your fillings -- because maybe he couldn't see you? maybe he's just an asshole and wants to scare you? Whatever the reason, it makes me wish I had a rear-firing missile launcher built into the Miata. But then I'd have even less trunk space.
