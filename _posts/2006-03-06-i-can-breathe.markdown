I just got back from the schnoz doctor where the remaining clotted blood and other assorted goop was removed from my sinus cavities.

By gods, I can breathe. Really, breathe. Like a normal person. This is so weird.

I can't actually remember a time when I could actually breathe. Maybe when I was a young `un. But certainly not within my adulthood.

`Course, now my nose hurts like hell again -- Dr. Colden shoved wads of gauze soaked with an anesthetic up there before firing up the diesel-powered roto-rooter. And the anesthetic has now worn off.

Still, breathing is so cool.
