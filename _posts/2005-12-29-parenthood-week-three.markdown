Here are ten additional things I have learned:

1. Molly definitely has acid reflux, and needs to take Zantac.

2. Molly almost certainly does NOT have acid reflux, but she may be colicky due to a food allergy/intolerance.

3. I really am willing to do just about anything for this new little being, including giving up my favorite foods (cheese, yogurt, anything dairy or soy) for at least a week.

4. Breastfeeding can give babies acne.

5. My cranky hours are between 3 and 5 am. 

6. Coincidentally, the hours Molly are most likely to suddenly be wide awake are between 3 and 5 am.

7. It is possible for a baby's rectum to shoot poo <b>6 feet</b> across a room! (more from Jeff on that one...)

8. My baby is the only being I personally know with more gas than myself. We will definitely tease her about that later on. She may look like a little lady, but she certainly does not sound like one.

9. You can survive Christmas without giving anyone a present. Although next year, as the new baby will no longer be new, I suspect we will have to resume with the gift-giving.

10. I may not have been born a good parent, but I really am learning to become one. (I have a still-living and thriving child to prove it.) And it does get easier...
