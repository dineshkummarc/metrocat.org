We've been remiss in getting the photographs from our wedding finished. Now I understand what a wedding photographer gets paid several thousand dollars to do: tweak the levels, clone bricks and generally take good raw materials and from them create lasting memories.

Anna and I were married on Friday, 28 November at New York City Hall. In attendance were all of our immediate family, Anna's cousin Kim and her husband Nick, and Anna's Godfather and his wife.

We will be sending out cards for New Years that include a number of 4x6 prints of some of the highlights from the wedding. If Anna will allow me, I'll post some of them here once they are ready.
