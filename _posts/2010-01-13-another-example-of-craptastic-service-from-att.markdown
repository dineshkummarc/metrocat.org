title: Another Example of Craptastic Service from AT&T

I just got a call from a telemarketer (a recorded call, the most evil variety) and so I called AT&T to make certain they weren't selling my phone number to telemarketing firms. After waiting a couple minutes on hold, I was asked to "verify my identity" by providing the last 4 digits of my Social Security Number.

Now, there are few things that piss me off more than having to provide any part of my SSN for any purpose that doesn't involve someone giving **me** money. However, every other company I've ever done business with allows for an alternative method of identification. Not AT&T. No. In order to do anything, you have to provide the last 4 digits.

Want to talk to a supervisor to complain about the stupid policy? You have to provide the last 4 digits of your SSN.

Perfect!
