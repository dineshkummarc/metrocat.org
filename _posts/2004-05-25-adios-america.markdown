Well, here we go- off to England for our honeymoon! Two weeks of walking and drinking (beer) in the beautiful wet and wild countryside of Great Britain. Plane flight aside, I can hardly wait.

It has been almost exactly <b>10 years</b> since I last saw England. Ten years?! Things have changed so dramatically in a decade, even when I just consider the microcosm of my life. I can only imagine how much an entire country has changed.

Of course, there will be posts upon our return. That is, <b>if</b> we decide to return.
