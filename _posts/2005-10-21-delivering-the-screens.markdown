We're deep in the throws of releasing a new product. And I'm the guy building the user interface. While that's fun, our rather over-ambitious schedule -- delivering frozen code by 11 November -- means I've had to crank out massive UI goodness in minimal time.

This includes a complete framework for building user interfaces in our product -- which otherwise has no visible front-end. Just a little challenging.

As a result, I haven't had time for pleasantries: calling friends, being nice to my pregnant wife, and taking poor, long suffering Augustus for walks.

Thank gods the weekend is coming. Augustus will get his walk after all!
