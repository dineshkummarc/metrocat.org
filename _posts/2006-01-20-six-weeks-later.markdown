...and we are all still alive. More or less. 

"They" say that colic is at its worst at six weeks. I certainly hope so. I cannot imagine another several months of the same behavior as the past one and a half. 

<b>Update</b>: Ironically, when I started this post two days ago, things were really very bad. Last night, Molly nearly slept through the night. She probably would have, except I freaked out and (mostly) woke her up around 2am.

Now, we just have to figure out if it was something we did (we let her sleep with us), the result of a growth spurt otherwise sapping her energy, or something else entirely.

If she continues to sleep the day away I will have time to post new photos. If not, I hope to do that this weekend.
