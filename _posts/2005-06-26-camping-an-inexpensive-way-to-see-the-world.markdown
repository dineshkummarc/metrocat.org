Well, it is the way some people do it. Obviously, I haven't got the knack for camping cheaply: Anna helped me rack up a $420 total bill at REI yesterday picking up gear for our upcoming trip to Vermont.

Nothing we purchased was really expensive. No $300 tents. No $150 soft-shell jackets. But somehow it all added up to a staggering sum.

We bought one of those ultra-cool [Jetboil][jetboil] personal stoves. Of course, we couldn't forget a fuel canister. And a stabiliser and pot-adapter. Now we can try out some of the really cool (and some really weird) [recipes on the Jetboil Web site][jetboil-recipes]. When the food is done, we can serve it on our Lexan plates, or in our Lexan bowls, and drink *something* from our Lexan cups. Woo hoo! for Lexan: it's light weight and blue.

Also adding to the shocking bottom line were several shirts, a couple pairs of pants, and some miscellaneous stuff. Nothing outrageous mind you, just not free.

Of course, this now gives me a *really* good excuse to go camping this summer and autumn -- got to make use of all the stuff we bought!
