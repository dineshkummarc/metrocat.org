This afternoon we received confirmation that we'll actually have a place to live once we leave Newburyport. Hooray!

Beginning on the first of the year, we'll be residents of the [Harbor Steps](http://www.harborsteps.com/) and our address will be:

> 1301 First Avenue #312<br>
> Seattle, WA 98101

Most importantly for me, we'll be three blocks south of the Crumpet Shop. So I'll be able to get my tea and a crumpet each morning before going to work.

Of course, Anna is excited about all the opportunities the location offers for her and Molly: we're across the street from the [Seattle Art Museum](http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/) (where the Art of Jazz concerts are held), a few blocks from the [Seattle Aquarium](http://www.seattleaquarium.org/) and the [Pike Place Market](http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/), and a short trip by Monorail from [Seattle Center](http://www.seattlecenter.com/) where there's a [Children's Museum](http://www.thechildrensmuseum.org/), the [Pacific Science Center](http://www.pacsci.org/), and the [Science _Fiction_ Museum](http://www.sfhomeworld.org/) (how cool can you get?).

We're pretty excited, but first we have to finish packing...
