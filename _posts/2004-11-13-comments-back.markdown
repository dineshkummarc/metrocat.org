<p>Well, I'm willing to give it a try... comments have been turned back
on. Now don't all rush to comment on your favourite post. Truly, we
only get one or two comments a month; so I'm not certain why we
bother.</p>
<p>To prevent further spam, I've changed the name of the program that
processes the comments. The spammers look for Web sites with links to
common comment programs (mt-comment.cgi in our case) and lock in on
those. By changing the name, we'll fool them for a while.</p>
<p>Let's cross our fingers and hope!</p>
