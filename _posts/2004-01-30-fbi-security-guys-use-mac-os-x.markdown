While poking around the net this morning keeping up to date on the latest news, I ran across this fascinating article over at <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com">Security Focus</a> entitled <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/cgi-bin/sfonline/columnists-item.pl? id=215">A Visit from the FBI</a>. The following quote really caught my eye:

> Dave \[the FBI Agent\] had some surprises up his sleeve as well. You'll remember that I said he was using a ThinkPad (running Windows!). I asked him about that, and he told us that many of the computer security folks back at FBI HQ use Macs running OS X, since those machines can do just about anything: run software for Mac, Unix, or Windows, using either a GUI or the command line. And they're secure out of the box.

Of course, Dave the FBI agent later went on to say that they couldn't afford to purchase Mac laptops. That's a real shame. At least they know a good system when they see one.
