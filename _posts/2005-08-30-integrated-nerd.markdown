In the weeks ahead (I'd say days if I weren't so busy/lazy), I'll be integrating my technology Weblog, [nerd.newburyportion](http://metrocat.org/nerd/), back into the main Web site. It will still be focused on technology/programming issues, but it will feel like a *part* of the overall newburyportion Web site. This means stylistic changes to unify them -- although I still like the charcoal and "piss yellow" (as [my buddy Josh](http://www.bokardo.com/) called it).

Anna also wants her own Web site, which will be integrated here, but be stylistically all her own. (Hint, hint, you lazy devil: the sooner you draw up the design, the sooner I can code it.)

Work, work, work...
