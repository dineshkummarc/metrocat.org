<p>It's that time again. After nearly a full year with my current
employer, I've decided the company just isn't for me. The goals I set
when I started simply haven't been met; and I don't have confidence
that they will be met should I stick around any longer.</p>
<p>So once again, I'm looking for a job.</p>
<p>Anna and I will be moving out of the Jersey City area when our lease
expires at the end of March. Therefore, we're actually fairly flexible
about the location component of any job I pursue. But for family
reasons, I think we'd like to stay on the east coast; and I think we'd
probably prefer the North East. But, as I said, I'm actually fairly
flexible.</p>
<p>With over a decade of senior development experience including more
than five years of leadership and management experience, I'd like to
focus on software product development. It's where my strengths lie; and
in the past, it's where I've had the most fun. I'm confident my
technical skills are up to the challenge of an Architect position; and
my project management and people management skills are more than a
match for a Development Manager position.</p>
<p>Here's the snag: New York City doesn't have many independent
software development companies. Most development teams are embedded in
financial services companies or the consulting companies that serve
them. I don't really have any interest in getting into the financial
services world, which is fortunate, because you can't get in if you
haven't any financial services experience.</p>
<p>I'm actually relieved by this. I don't like New York City much. I
know I haven't really given it a fair shot at impressing me; but that's
life. I'd like to leave.</p>
<p>I'll share my thoughts on an ideal location later...</p>
