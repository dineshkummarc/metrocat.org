Monday morning found me squatting on a stool in Anna's midwife's office waiting to listen to the heart beat of [The Bean][bean]. Lisa, the midwife, entered, squirted some cold goo on Anna's belly, and whipped out the doppler radar device (I've not bothered to [figure out how this thing works][spock-doppler]).

Shortly after placing a part of the doppler thingy on Anna's belly, the swusht, swusht, swusht sound of a little helicopter filled the room. I'm not kidding. He sounds like a whirly bird.

Immediately, I began to have premonitions of walking through the park holding a tether while our son hovers overhead -- but not directly overhead until after he's toilet trained. And of course, the cost of aviation gas will be a limiting factor in how much spare cash we'll have for the next few decades...
