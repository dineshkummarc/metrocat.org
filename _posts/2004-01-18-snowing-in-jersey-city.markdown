It's snowing again here in Jersey City. While Anna sat around the
house being cranky, I went out for a walk. Fortunately, I thought to
bring along the Canon 10D; and I made some photographs while I was
out.

<p>Part of my walk took me along the Hudson River where there is a little
floating dock. During the summer months, a local sailing school ties up
its sailboats here. No sailboats today.</p>

We've decided to move back to New York when our lease expires.
Although this will mean a much longer commute for me each day, we
really don't like Jersey City. I'd love to say that there was only one
reason why we didn't like the area; but there are almost too many
reasons to list.

couple had just exited from the Path station. For some reason, the guy
was lugging a suitcase which probably belonged to the woman.</p>
</div>

So we're looking for an apartment somewhere along either the Hudson
or Harlem lines of MetroNorth. I expect to have about an hour and a
half to two hour commute each day; but the benefit will be that we can
live out where there's grass and trees and other good stuff.

<p>In honour of the tragedy on 9/11, Jersey City has this bent
and twisted girder on display along the waterfront.</p>
</div>

A couple weekends ago, Anna and I hopped a train up to Mount Kisco.
It's an okay little town; but it really isn't as nice as Katonah -- the
next town north along the Harlem line. I'm even thinking about renting
a condo up in the Pawling or Patterson area. The really have grass up
there.

<p>I've never quite figured out what this writing means. But
it looks cool.</p>
</div>

Oddly enough, this is the same area where we fell in love with a
little cottage last year. Beyond not having a job with which to make
the mortgage payments, my chief complaint had been the 2 hour commute. How ironic.
