**1 day before period due.**

I had a very strange dream that I was being chased by man-eating trees. A cross between [Evil Dead II][1] and [The Wizard of Oz][2]. Trees would trip us with their roots, grab us with their branches and eat us. Only I was able to outrun them.

Flash forward a few years. I am a triathlete with a ponytail. Think Linda Hamilton from [ Terminator 2][3]. I am also a botanist and professor.

I return with my students to firebomb the evil, possessed woods.
