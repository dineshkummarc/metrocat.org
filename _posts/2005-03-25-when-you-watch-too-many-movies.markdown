<b>1 day before period due.</b>

I had a very strange dream that I was being chased by man-eating trees. A cross between <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~kyle-p/evildead2-deadites-trees.htm">Evil Dead II</a> and <a href="http://home.iprimus.com.au/scooterj5/tree.jpg">The Wizard of Oz</a>. Trees would trip us with their roots, grab us with their branches and eat us. Only I was able to outrun them.

Flash forward a few years. I am a triathlete with a ponytail. Think Linda Hamilton from <a href="http://www.art.com/asp/sp-asp/_/Aff--CONF/CTID--117337010/RFID--184451/TKID--15003778/pd--10034590/posters.htm"> Terminator 2</a>. I am also a botanist and professor.

I return with my students to firebomb the evil, possessed woods.
