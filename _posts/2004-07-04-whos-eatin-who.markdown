[The Union Fair][1] features booths from all sorts of local organisations. I
made it a point to stop and chat with many of the booth attendants, including
this gentleman manning an _Outdoorsman_ booth.

Either this guy was supremely patient or he simply didnâ€™t pick up on my
attitude regarding hunting. Regardless, he was good-natured enough to pose for
me.
