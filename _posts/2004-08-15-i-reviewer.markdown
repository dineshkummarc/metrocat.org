<p>Ah, summer (although this wacky weather nearly doesn't qualify).
Movie-makers know that both the small and the larger kids are on
vacation this time of year. All the kids want is eye-candy, unobscured
by all but the thinnest veil of meaning or plot.</p>
<p>"I, Robot" is eye-candy a plenty. How can any kid resist the lure of
a film filled with robots? Lots of robots. Angry, rebellious robots.
And one possibly murderous robot. Robots are cool, even if CG sometimes
makes them look a little silly. Robots are so cool in fact, that I
agreed with the VIKI program, and I was rooting for the robot rebellion
to succeed. </p>
<p>Ah yes, I cannot forget the cool car, and a decent motorcycle. Both
of course involved in obligatory action/chase scenes resulting in
destruction of said vehicle.</p>
<p>There was even additional eye candy for just for the adults: one
half-naked and then fully nude Will Smith, and one showering chick
whose name I don't know.</p>
<p>Like too much candy, the movie seemed like a great idea at the time,
but afterwards Jeff and I both suffered ill effects: Jeff had a
headache, and I was in a daze. </p>
<p>I will most likely pass when this one comes to DVD, but I plan to
check out the Asimov work that "suggested" it (<a

previous movie (the somewhat superior <a
