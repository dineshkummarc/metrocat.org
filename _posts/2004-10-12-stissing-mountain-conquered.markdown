This Sunday, Anna and I returned to Stissing Mountain. We'd hiked around the
pond and [tried to climb Stissing Mountain][1] earlier in the Summer. But this
time we were in much better shape.

Although Anna hasn't been hiking this summer as often as I have, the trip to
England was definitely good for her stamina and leg strength. We trudged up
the steep slope to the top of Stissing Mountain in twenty to thirty minutes. I
climbed the fire tower and enjoyed the commanding view of Dutchess County, and
Anna stayed on the ground to make certain my pack didn't wander off all by
itself.

Unlike our last visit, I wasn't testing out any _really_ new gear, but it was
the first time I'd been able to actually _wear_ my [REI One jacket][2]. On
previous outings, the jacket was **too** warm for me to wear. Yes, too warm.
Even with the temperatures down in the low 60s or high 50s, I generate too
much body heat to wear the One jacket. But on the walk around Thompson's Pond,
the pace and terrain was easy enough, and the temperature cold enough, that I
needed the jacket to be comfortable. Had I kept the jacket on for the climb up
Stissing Mountain, I'm certain I would have overheated again; therefore, it
stayed in the car.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the jacket. It's perhaps a bit more snug than I
would have expected -- certainly more snug than the photograph on REI's Web
site led me to believe. But [as I continue to lose weight][3], it will fit
even better. And now that we'll be moving up to the border between NH and MA
-- where there's an REI store -- it will be even better to have a jacket that
does such a terrific job keeping me warm.
