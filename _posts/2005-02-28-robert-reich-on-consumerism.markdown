In [Robert Reich's latest column in the New York Times][reich-nyt] I have finally found a mainstream voice for my own thoughts. Although I despise Wal-Mart and never shop there, I don't actually blame Wal-Mart executives or Sam Walton for the destruction of downtown shopping districts. That decimation lies squarely on the shoulders of American consumers: so besotted with "rolled back prices" that they forget that the money they pay for goods at Wal-Mart leaves their community thereby impoverishing it.

Now one forces us to buy books from Amazon instead of the local bookstore. As Reich admits:

<blockquote cite="http://nytimes.com/2005/02/28/opinion/28reich.html">
The problem is, the choices we make in the market don't fully reflect our values as workers or as citizens. I didn't want our <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5671" title="Independent booksellers can't compete with Amazon">community bookstore in Cambridge, Mass.</a>, to close (as it did last fall) yet I still bought lots of books from Amazon.com. In addition, we may not see the larger bargain when our own job or community isn't directly at stake. I don't like what's happening to airline workers, but I still try for the cheapest fare I can get.

Recently, I've been trying to find a shop in Newburyport that sells Levi's jeans. (Of course, Anna would like me to make the switch to [No Sweat Apparel][no-sweat], but I'm comfortable with Levi's even if they are no longer made in the USA.) We have both a Marshall's and a K-Mart in the shopping plazas, but I'd much rather find a merchant downtown who sells jeans. Hell, I'd love to find a merchant downtown who will be willing to even order a pair of Levi's for me even if he doesn't normally carry them.

I'll admit that I also buy a fair number of books and CDs from either Amazon or Barnes & Noble online. While we lived in Rhinebeck, my excuse was that few of the books I was looking for were available from either the library or the local bookstores. But that was just a cop out.

When I lived in Seattle, I prided myself on only purchasing from local merchants (where at all possible) even if I had to pay a premium for the privilege. I bought my [W&uuml;stof Dreizack knives][knives] from a Market merchant. I bought my pots and pans from another shop that specialised in kitchenware. I did have to visit Bed Bath & Beyond several times because, oddly enough, none of the small merchants carried things like brooms or mops.

Now that I once again live in a town with a vibrant shopping district (even if it does cater to tourists), I feel it only makes sense to support those merchants by shopping here first. I know it will mean we pay a bit more for the things we buy, but if it makes us think a bit more about our purchases, so much the better.
