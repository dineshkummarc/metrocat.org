Everywhere we went in the Cotswolds was resplendent with flowers. I captured
this flower just as it was waking up for the morning as we walked through
Lower Slaughter.

It really is remarkable. As we walked along the edge of a field sown with some
sort of grain (what a great farmer I’d make) and as we came to the corner of
the field, there was a ancient maple with _wild_ flowers growing around its
base. However, these wild flowers weren’t terribly wild. They clearly belonged
in someone’s garden. Perhaps they had escaped and found their way to this
little oasis amidst the sheep droppings.
