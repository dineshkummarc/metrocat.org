After complaining incessantly that the camera I bought *us* just before our wedding didn't feel like a shared camera, but felt more like *my* personal camera, Anna finally has her own camera.

I wanted to buy her a camera that was small enough to tote everywhere, but that still used Compact Flash cards -- so we wouldn't have to buy more memory cards and another card reader.

I hope she'll allow me to borrow it when we're hiking the week of 4 July, otherwise there won't be any photos of Preggo hiking, because the Canon 10D (which I suppose I should now call *my camera*) needs to be sent to Canon for repairs to the on-off switch.
