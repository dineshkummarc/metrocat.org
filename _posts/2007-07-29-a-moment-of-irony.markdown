So, I was finally inspired this evening to read <a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/Its-All-Too-Much-Living/dp/0743292642/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-0478162-6793605?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1185770437&sr=8-1">It's All Too Much</a>, a decluttering/organization book that my mother was kind enough to lend me before she read it herself. (Perhaps after years of living with me, and then visiting me, she knew I might need it more than she did. Thanks, Mom!)

One of the first things that the author asks the reader to do is to imagine your ideal life. I naturally wanted to work the answer out on paper.

Now where the heck was a pen?

I might need more help than even this book can give...
