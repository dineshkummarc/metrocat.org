<p>The year 2003 has not yet drawn to a close, and yet I find myself
already trying to imagine what 2004 might bring for my new hubby and I.
</p>
<p>We are planning to start our family next year, and so I think about
the state of the world into which I will bring a new human being. This
thought does not make me happy. Let me clarify- the idea of the new
human <i>does</i>, the state of the world <i>does not</i>.</p>
<p>So, what do I plan to do about this? What can one person do to make
the world a better place? How I can figure this out in a limited amount
of time?</p>
<p>I don't know. </p>
<p>But, I intend to find out. And I plan on sharing any possible
revelations I have with you, the one or two people on the net who
actually read this site.</p>
