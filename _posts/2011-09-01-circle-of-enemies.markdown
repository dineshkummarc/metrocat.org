I just finished reading _Circle of Enemies_ by Harry Connolly last night. I first heard of his work when he was the [guest blogger on Charles Stross' Web site](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/02/introducing-harry-connolly.html). Stross writes the excellent Laundry series and also the Merchant Prince series, both of which I've enjoyed tremendously. So when he recommended Connolly's work, I took the plunge and downloaded it to my iPad.

Connolly tells compelling stories while giving readers a small glimpse into the world he's crafted. My only complaint is they're a quick read. So waiting for the next book will be challenging.
