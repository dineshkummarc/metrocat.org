Now that we live in northern Massachusetts it’s even easier for us to get away
to one of our favourite vacation spots: [Camden, Maine][1].

We popped up for a quick overnight the first weekend of June — arriving on
Saturday in time to go for a short hike in Camden Hills State Park where we
found these pretty flowers gracing the side of the trail.
