<p>Lean in a little bit closer, so you can hear (or technically, read) my horrible confession...</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Since sometime last year, I have been going on about how I wanted to try to become Vegan for one month. Just one little month.</p> 

<p>Well, at the beginning of this year, I proclaimed that February would be "Meat-Free February". Granted, I chose that particular month because it was the shortest month. However, as they say, the road to hell is indeed paved with good intentions, and in February, I got sick. Bleh.</p>

<p>So March was now going to be "Meatless March". I borrowed more cookbooks from the library, and prepared Jeff mentally for the ordeal by preparing some vegetarian dishes.</p>

<p>Then it happened. Maybe it started with the frequent eating of spinach salads with blue cheese crumbles. Maybe it sunk in the other day while I was in the grocery store, and the thought of bangers and mash (small pork sausages with garlicky mashed potatoes) made me drool. But regardless, I can't do it.</p>

<p>Oh sure, if you call me on breaking my "promise" I'll mention that Jeff and I are trying to start our family, and I am not sure that now is the right time to start extreme dietary experimentation. That's a fairly good reason. But then again, how I am supposed to encourage our children to follow through on any of their own convictions, dietary or otherwise if I can't stick to my own. I AM opposed to factory farming, the thought literally makes me sick. But I LOOOOOVE cheese, and no amount of soy or other substitute will do. I have tried, albeit on a limited basis. And although I've seen the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112431/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTUwMHx0dD1vbnxmYj11fHBuPTB8cT1CYWJlfGh0bWw9MXxubT1vbg__;fc=1;ft=102;fm=1">Babe</a> a number of times, I still agree with both my husband and <a href="http://www.supersizeme.com">Morgan Spurlock</a>'s statement that "swine is fine".</p>

<p>There you have it. Maybe I can become a "lacto-porko". Or maybe I can just try to eat the healthiest I can, and occasionally indulge in a big, juicy, brain-rotting burger, with blue cheese and bacon. Mmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the comments are disabled on this website, so all of the angry non-animal eaters will just have to keep their comments to themselves... Isn't that what makes this country great?</p>

<p>But seriously folks, those of you who have my email address are welcome to send me comments and recipes sans meat. Heck, I'll meet you half way. As of next week, I will try to give up chicken. After all, there are so many other things that taste like it, it should be easy.</p>
