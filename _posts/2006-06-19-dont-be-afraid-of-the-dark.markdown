So when I was a wee lad there was a commercial on teevee from Beck's promoting their dark beers. The commercial featured Martin Mull and attempted to dispel the myth that "dark beer is only for people named Gunter with thick necks." The tag line for the campaign was "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark."

Last night, I learned that The Dark is perhaps a little frightening after all.

Anna and I watched the new Battlestar Gallactica pilot. All I can say is "that was dark." Really dark. Particularly the part where the new President has to decide whether to take all the <abbr title="Faster Than Light">FTL</abbr>-capable ships and escape the Cylons while leaving the non-FTL-capable ships behind. Tough decision. Tougher still to learn that the cute child she had just been talking with last scene was on one of the non-FTL-capable ships.

On the one hand, I think it speaks well of the writers and producers if they're willing to air such a dark and gloomy series.

I think I'm going to love it.
