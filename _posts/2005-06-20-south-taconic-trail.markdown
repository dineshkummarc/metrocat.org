The last time Anna and I attempted the ascent onto the South Taconic trail, it all ended in tears. Anna's tears specifically. It was early last summer and she really wasn't in good enough shape to climb such a steep hill in somewhat warm weather.

Yesterday, after visiting with Anna's family, we returned to the South Taconic trail. Ideally, I'd hoped we could hike for about 5 to 7 miles. However, I was a little apprehensive about asking Anna to re-attempt the ascent that not only defeated her, but made her cry. I told her to set the pace and to stop and rest whenever she needed. It was slow going -- and she needed a Luna bar about half way up (it was about 1.30 PM and we hadn't eaten since breakfast at 9:30 AM) -- but she made it all the way to the top of Bash Bish Mountain.

Once at the top, however, she declared that her hiking escapades were complete for the day and asked whether there was a less steep descent we could use. The only other descent that would have brought us back to the parking lot where we'd left the Miata was the blue trail, which crosses the stream above Bash Bish falls. The blue trail isn't as rocky and steep but it is still pretty steep.

While the blue trail isn't as clearly blazed as the white, South Taconic trail, we never really lost our way -- we did have to scan around a few times to locate the next blue blaze. Anna didn't enjoy the fantastic view from the overlooks along the trail, but she did manage to descend without too much difficulty.

And she did all of this while 16 weeks pregnant.
