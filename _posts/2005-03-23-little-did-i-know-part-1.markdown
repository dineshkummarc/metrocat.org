**3 days before period due.**

Today I wasted a perfectly good pregnancy test. BFN (Big Fat Negative). I was devastated. I cried myself to sleep, and when Jeff came home, I woke up and cried some more.

"Why is it so easy for people who <i>don't</i> want kids to get pregnant, and I want kids so much and I can't get pregnant?" I sobbed. Jeff was unable to comfort me.
