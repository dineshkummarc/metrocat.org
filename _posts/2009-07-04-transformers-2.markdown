The other day Anna and I went to see [Transformers 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1055369/) in spite of having read [the io9 review: Michael Bay Finally Made An Art Movie](http://io9.com/5301898/michael-bay-finally-made-an-art-movie). We were prepared for something _special_.

The best I can say about the movie is that it was too loud for me to fall asleep.
