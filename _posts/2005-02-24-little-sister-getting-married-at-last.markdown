It seems that we've started a trend. Dianne called last night to announce that she and Joe have decided to *elope* in a small ceremony in the Florida Keys. Specifically, they'll tie the knot on Saturday, 30 April, 2005 at [Little Palm Island][little-palm-island].

Anna and I will buy our plane tickets in the next couple days. We'll fly into Key West, rent a car, and drive the 20 miles north to Little Palm Island. Perhaps we'll even spend a couple days in Key West after Dianne and Joe say "I do".
