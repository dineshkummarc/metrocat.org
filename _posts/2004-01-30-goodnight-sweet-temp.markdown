<p>As many of you are probably already too aware, for the past four
months I have been working as a temp for a local financial services
company. In fact, yesterday I celebrated the fact that I had been
working for <i>exactly</i> four months continuously- almost a new
personal record (since I returned from California).</p>
<p>Alas, it would appear that today is my last.</p>
<p>I have been quite fortunate- most temps don't last more than a
month. I have met a number of really sweet people who I would consider
my friends. I have also had the opportunity to exercise and strengthen
some of my flabby office skills, and gained the confidence to try new
roles I had not even though of previously.</p>
<p>But damn, I am not happy about my impending departure! </p>
<p>As my good buddy, Hamlet, once said:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Who would [9-5] bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br/>
	but that the dread of something after [employment],<br/>
	the undiscovered country from whose bourn no [worker] returns, <br/>
	puzzles the will, and makes us rather bear [that job] we have, <br/>
	then fly to others we know not of?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I'm being overly dramatic about this. </p>
<p>No, not me.</p>
