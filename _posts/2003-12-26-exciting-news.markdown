<p>Jeff and I returned home at about 6pm yesterday evening, having
spent both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with both branches of my
family in the wilds of the Hudson Valley. Actually we had a really
wonderful time, in spite of the pouring rain and rapidly dropping
temperatures.</p>
<p>However, one of the most interesting things happened while we were
still in Kingston. Soon before we left for the bus station, I called my
cousin Kim to wish  her and Nick (her husband) both a happy holiday.</p>
<p>She surprised me with the wonderful news that she was two months
pregnant. In fact, she had found out she was pregnant the week before
our wedding, but wanted to wait to be certain everything was fine
before announcing the news.</p>
<p>I am <b>very</b> excited for them! My cousin and I were always
rather close, as we were born approximately six months apart, and spent
our childhood together. Perhaps, if we are lucky, our children might do
the same!</p>
<p>And, for the record, I am <b>NOT</b> "preggers" myself at this
time... </p>
