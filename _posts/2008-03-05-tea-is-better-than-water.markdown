From a recent article on the Beeb, [Tea 'healthier' drink than water](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5281046.stm):

> Drinking three or more cups of tea a day is as good for you as drinking plenty of water and may even have extra health benefits, say researchers.

This makes my plan of drinking several pots of tea a day seem even better! The article then goes on to state:

> Tea not only rehydrates as well as water does, but it can also protect against heart disease and some cancers, UK nutritionists found.

and:

> [Dr Ruxton] said it was an urban myth that tea is dehydrating.

> "Studies on caffeine have found very high doses dehydrate and everyone assumes that caffeine-containing beverages dehydrate. But even if you had a really, really strong cup of tea or coffee, which is quite hard to make, you would still have a net gain of fluid.

Hooray for Tea!
