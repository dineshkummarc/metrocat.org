The [New York Times mobile Web site](http://mobile.nytimes.com) has been around for a while now, but I've never really appreciated it.

Mostly what I didn't like was the pagination of the articles. I'm a reader. I like to read and having to click on the next page link three or four time to read an article was a drag.

(I'm still holding out hope that Apple will release a large format iPod touch because I'll buy two: one for me to use as an ebook reader and one for Molly to watch videos on.)

But just tonight I realised that if you click on the single page link at the bottom of the article, the Times will remember that. **The next article you read will also be served as a single page.**

Woo hoo!

Update: I'm only disappointed that I can't use the mobile interface from desktop Safari.
