<p>Well, this is hardly the exciting and detail-packed update I had
promised last time.</p>
<p>Jeff and I have been fiddling with images of my wedding accessories;
but now that our extremely snazzy new digital camera has arrived,
perhaps we will abandon my original polaroids for some higher quality
pictures to give everyone a preview of the day.</p>
<p>Actually, since the wedding is just a little over a week away,
perhaps we should just wait and post the photos from the <i>actual</i>
event. And let me just take a minute to pause and reflect on this
phrase: "<b>the wedding is just a little over a week away</b>"...</p>
<p>But first, let me digress for a moment. My present job, temporary
receptionist in the human resources department of a financial services
company (<a href="http://www.pershing.com">Pershing</a>), is both a
blessing and a curse during this time:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A blessing, because it has kept me busy enough that I do not
	obsess over what, by all accounts, will be one of the biggest days
	of my life.</li>
	<li>A curse, because it leaves me so completely drained, so
	completely numb (except for those moments when I am in a bad mood-
	don't ask) that I feel that I am unable to fully enjoy the time
	leading up to the big day.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, I suppose I shouldn't complain. This job is part of the reason
we will be able to pull this off in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Now, if I could just relax before then.</p>
<p>And let me say this,<b> if one more person asks me if I am
nervous...</b></p>
