Well, this is hardly the exciting and detail-packed update I had promised last time.

Jeff and I have been fiddling with images of my wedding accessories; but now that our extremely snazzy new digital camera has arrived, perhaps we will abandon my original polaroids for some higher quality pictures to give everyone a preview of the day.

Actually, since the wedding is just a little over a week away, perhaps we should just wait and post the photos from the _actual_ event. And let me just take a minute to pause and reflect on this phrase: "**the wedding is just a little over a week away**"...

But first, let me digress for a moment. My present job, temporary receptionist in the human resources department of a financial services company ([Pershing][1]), is both a blessing and a curse during this time:

1. A blessing, because it has kept me busy enough that I do not obsess over what, by all accounts, will be one of the biggest days of my life.
2. A curse, because it leaves me so completely drained, so completely numb (except for those moments when I am in a bad mood- don't ask) that I feel that I am unable to fully enjoy the time leading up to the big day.

But, I suppose I shouldn't complain. This job is part of the reason we will be able to pull this off in such a short period of time.

Now, if I could just relax before then.

And let me say this, **if one more person asks me if I am nervous...**
