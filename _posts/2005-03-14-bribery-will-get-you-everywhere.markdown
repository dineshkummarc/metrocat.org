<p>In the months since moving to Newburyport, my dearest husband Jeff has
tried any number of techniques to get yours truly to take up writing rather than, as he likes to put it, "sitting around all day and eating bon-bons."
These have included: hinting, openly suggesting, flattering my writing skills, insisting, and now finally, <i>bribery</i>.</p> 

<p>From now on I will have to earn my weekly "allowance" by writing something, anything. I get paid <b>one whole penny</b> per word, which means in order to earn the full 20$USD, I will have to write two thousands words.</p>

<p>Only 1,900 more to go.</p>
