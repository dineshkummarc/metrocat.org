<p>Just when I thought we had SPAM licked, the spamming bastards start
using track-back pings to ruin our Web site. I've spent most of the
morning deleting track-back pings and configuring our templates to
prevent any further abuse. I've also completely removed the ability for
this installation of <a href="http://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>
to accept incoming track-back pings.</p>
<p>I know that's a pretty brute-force solution, but I'm not really
clever enough to work out a better one. Maybe when I finally upgrade to
MT 3.15 (or whatever) I'll install the blacklist plug-in to help
prevent SPAM...</p>
