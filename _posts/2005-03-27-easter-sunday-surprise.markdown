**1 day *after* period is due.**

I spent the day with Mom, and ate more ham than I ever thought humanly possible. Jeff returned to Newburyport.

Just for the heck of it, I took a pregnancy test that evening.

TWO PINK LINES !?!?

This can't be right, I thought. I was happy, and numb, and alone. I had no phone, and it was too late to call anyone anyway.

I decided to buy more tests the next day, but sleep then, as I must have been dreaming...
