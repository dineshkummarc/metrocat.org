<p>Josh Marshall asks the following really excellent question on his
weblog, <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com">Talking Points
Memo</a>:</p>

<blockquote

	<p>Should an advisor to the Pentagon be pocketing a fee for helping
	to raise money for a terrorist organization?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue seems to be that everyone's favourite hawk, Richard Perle,
was paid to give a speech to a group that the state department
considers to be a terrorist organisation. Perle is the same guy who's
been beating the drums about going to war with Iran and the rest of the
Axis of Evil.</p>
<p>You should really read both <a

the first entry discussing the Perle matter</a> and the <a

follow up entry</a>.</p>
<p>Marshall provides really excellent commentary on the media's
coverage of politics. He's a little left of center; but definitely not
-- as my father likes to say -- a "liberal mouthpiece".</p>
