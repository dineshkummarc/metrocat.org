Josh Marshall asks the following really excellent question on his weblog, <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com">Talking Points Memo</a>:

> Should an advisor to the Pentagon be pocketing a fee for helping to raise money for a terrorist organization?

The issue seems to be that everyone's favourite hawk, Richard Perle, was paid to give a speech to a group that the state department considers to be a terrorist organisation. Perle is the same guy who's been beating the drums about going to war with Iran and the rest of the Axis of Evil.

You should really read both <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_01_25.php#002503"> the first entry discussing the Perle matter</a> and the <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_01_25.php#002504"> follow up entry</a>.

Marshall provides really excellent commentary on the media's coverage of politics. He's a little left of center; but definitely not -- as my father likes to say -- a "liberal mouthpiece".
