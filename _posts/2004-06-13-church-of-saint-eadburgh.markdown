We visited the church of Saint Eadburgh just outside of Broadway. It dates
from Norman times (so I’m told) and is still in active use.

I was struck by the casual elegance of the flowers and candles in one of the
windows. Sure, the church is outside one of the move heavily touristed towns
in the region and so could be expected to put on a bit of a show. But I didn’t
feel like they were doing anything special. This was just how they decorated
their local church. That the church is many hundreds of years old makes no
difference.
