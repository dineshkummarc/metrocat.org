It's everywhere! The snow started around 6 PM last night and is still falling this morning. The roads look a mess and the sidewalks are 6 to 10 inches deep in snow.

Oh! How I look forward to my commute this morning.

I'm distinctly envious of my buddy Bradley, who lives within walking distance of his job at <a href="http://faculty.wiu.edu/CB-Dilger/">Western Illinois University</a>. And now that he doesn't have to spend all his time flunking freshman, life must be grand.
