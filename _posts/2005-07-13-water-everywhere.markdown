Along the Haselton Trail we encountered countless little springs all feeding
into the brook running beside the trail.

Both Anna and I soaked up some gloriously cool spring water in our bandanas to
cool off. One advantage to not having any hair is that I was able to rub the
wet bandana _all_ around my head. Woo! That was cold.
