<p>Don't let anyone fool you- filmmaking is not glamorous, it's just
hard work. I have spent more time on my feet these past few weeks than
I probably have in the past few (or maybe several) years combined! </p>
<p>I wonder if my body and my mind are up to the challenge.</p>
<p>Our office has quite literally become a "mexican soap opera", as my
boss puts it.  I wish I could go into more details, but I will simply
say that there is probably more drama behind the camera than the
dailies indicate are in front of it. </p>
<p>The gods continue to conspire against us, sending torrential rains
and lightning to grace our exterior sequences, blistering temperatures
and humidity (sans air conditioning) for our interior shots. Fun. There
was also an inexplicable incident in the production office, when a
flourescent light came crashing down in the center of the main room.
Spooky.</p>
<p>I was finally given an opportunity to work on set this past week,
and found it to be relatively simple and somewhat less stressful than
the office. Stay productive or stay out of the way, should be the
unofficial motto of those who serve on set.</p>
<p>I continue to learn more about the production process than I ever
had in film school, and continue to contemplate whether or not I will
ever be able to balance a real life with my newly discovered
<i>reel</i> one.  The work is definitely to my liking, but the hours
are not. So what will I do next? Well, we have approximately one more
week of production and possibly two weeks of wrap to go, and I will be
planning my next course of action during that time.</p>
<p>Now I must sleep, and save my energy for another week of the madness
that is moving-making!</p>
