<p>I have never found moving to be exciting in the least. Perhaps the
idea of starting a new life in a different local has a certain degree
of romance to it. But in my case, the actual process involves lots and
lots of <i>stuff</i>. To clarify, when I say lots of stuff, just
imagine 25 boxes of books. Just the books, and just the books that are
mine.</p>
<p>I am hoping this next move, back to the wilds of upstate New York,
will not kill us- or rather, me, when Jeff is forced to help me move my
boxes of things.</p>
<p>I am somewhat optimistic (but reservedly so) about the perceived
opportunity to live a simpler and hopefully less stressful existence.
Rhinebeck seems like a pretty swell little village, and it is my hope
that at least for a few years, it will be a suitable home for Mr.
Watkins, yours truly (aka Mrs. Watkins) and, at some point, wee
Watkinses as well.</p>
