<p>I just ran across <a
href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20010801/23213.html">an interesting
article in a back issue of Inc magazine</a> about one guy's decision to
base his career in Bozeman, Montana. What really struck me was this
quote from about half-way down the article:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20010801/23213.html">
	<p>I've recently come to realize that I've been a mere consumer of
	place, investing nothing in and giving little to the various
	communities that I've passed through. In the past my lack of
	connection showed in my aversion to buying a home -- I didn't want
	to be tied down by one, just in case I felt the itch to move on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds a lot like me and my recent discovery that I wanted a
real <i>home</i> where I could put down some roots and make a
difference.</p>
