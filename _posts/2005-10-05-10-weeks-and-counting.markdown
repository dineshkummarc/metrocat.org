Actually, by the time I post this entry, it will be less than 10 weeks. Nearly
8 weeks in fact until our little bean, um, sprouts forth from my belly.

I would like to state that, while I have enjoyed nearly all of this pregnancy
thing, the last trimester is proving to be the most difficult. I am tired, I
am achy, and I am carrying a rather heavy object in my mid-section.

That isnâ€™t quite accurate. Perhaps a better way to describe my current state
of preggie-ness is to say that I feel like I have swallowed a portion of a
sports supply store. A basketball ended up in my belly, two soccer balls
protrude from my hindquarters, and two softballs replaced the golf balls in my
chest region. I feel abundantly equipped these days, but I am too exhausted to
play any games.
