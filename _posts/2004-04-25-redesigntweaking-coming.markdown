<p>I just noticed a couple layout flaws with the current site design;
so I'll be looking at redoing the design in the coming days. I doubt it
will change significantly, because I kind of like the current look.</p>
<p>So, on the off chance that you've noticed anything weird (other than
the search fields not fitting in the box at the right) please let me
know...</p>
