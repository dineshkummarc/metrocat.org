So [Anna has a new camera](http://metrocat.org/2005/06/23/annas-new-camera). Based on her reaction to my constant bogarting of the device in question, she probably won't really consider it *hers* until my Canon 10D returns from the shop.

But I don't think she need worry much more about it, because *I've decided I don't much like the camera*. I couldn't figure out where it had decided to focus. I couldn't figure out where it was getting its exposure readings from. I really couldn't make it go at all.

Fully two thirds of the photos I took while on our trip to Vermont looked just fine in the LCD, but look like crap when I view them on my PowerBook. A few of these crummy photos could be rescued for use on Newburyportion because shrunk down they still look sharp, but in one case where I was photographing some flowers, *absolutely nothing* is in focus.

I suspect this is just a matter of getting accustomed to the device. Maybe even reading the users manual a bit. But I don't think I'll have the opportunity to use the device much in the future, so what's the point?
