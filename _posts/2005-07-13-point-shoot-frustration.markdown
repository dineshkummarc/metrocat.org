So [Anna has a new camera][1]. Based on her reaction to my constant bogarting
of the device in question, she probably won't really consider it _hers_ until
my Canon 10D returns from the shop.

But I don't think she need worry much more about it, because _I've decided I
don't much like the camera_. I couldn't figure out where it had decided to
focus. I couldn't figure out where it was getting its exposure readings from.
I really couldn't make it go at all.

Fully two thirds of the photos I took while on our trip to Vermont looked just
fine in the LCD, but look like crap when I view them on my PowerBook. A few of
these crummy photos could be rescued for use on Newburyportion because shrunk
down they still look sharp, but in one case where I was photographing some
flowers, _absolutely nothing_ is in focus.

I suspect this is just a matter of getting accustomed to the device. Maybe
even reading the users manual a bit. But I don't think I'll have the
opportunity to use the device much in the future, so what's the point?
