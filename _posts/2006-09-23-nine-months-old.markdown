Here are Molly's stats as of her 9 month checkup:

* Weight: 18.9 lbs
* Length: 27.75 inches
* Head: 75th percentile (she gets that from her father)

Between 8 and 9 months, Molly became a completely different baby. Every day she became more alert, aware, interactive, and awe-inspiring.

I suppose that was what every other baby her age was doing as well, but we were too busy for me to take a poll of other mothers.

Her new talents have included:

<ul> <li>waving bye-bye (although she seems to have stopped for now)</li> <li>clapping</li> <li>pulling up to standing, and sitting back down</li> <li>making lip-smacking or kissing sounds</li> <li>making mischief</li> </ul>

Molly has also amazed us with her interest in food, especially spicy or flavorful foods. It all started when she and I traveled to New York to visit our cousins and her grandparents. It was far easier and faster to have her sample whatever it was that I was eating (in addition to her usual liquid diet). When we attended the Dutchess County Fair, she had some of my pierogies, kielbasa, and sauerkraut, and kept trying to steal more!

Molly was also treated to pizza, (which in New York is an entirely different food than what is called pizza here in Massachusetts), and was never quite the same. In a positive way. She has since had Italian, Chinese, Thai, and Indian food, and much to everyone's surprise (including our own), really seems to love it all. What she doesn't love, she spits out. Fair enough. There's always the standard baby fare waiting for her, and she gets plenty of that too.

We were unsuccessful in our attempts to sell her to pirates:

We thought it might be good for expanding her horizons, but apparently they thought she was a little too young, even for swabbin' the decks. Sigh. Maybe next year.

She drives us crazy, but every day we fall more and more in love with our little girl.

Further updates in a couple of weeks. Hopefully, we will find the time and space for video next time around!
