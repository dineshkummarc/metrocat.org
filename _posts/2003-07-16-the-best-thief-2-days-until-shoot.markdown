The internship, apprenticeship, sinking ship (just kidding) goes very well. Tensions are high as we count down the days until the start of production. Monday we will see how well our preparations have paid off.

I was confined mostly to the office today, where I participated in traditional production work- typing, faxing, copying, sorting, delivering items, picking things up. I realized how privileged I have been the past few days, when I accompanied the Director, A.D., D.P., and Location Coordinator to location scouts. I had the rare opportunity to listen to them strategize their plans for the coming weeks, and to see our locations <i>before</i> the art department had a change to work their movie magic.

I have also been informed that I will most likely be taking over for the product placement intern when she joins the set crew next week. If this keeps up, I will have worked in nearly every department by the time the project wraps. I definitely see the advantages of working in the Hollywood system, where everyone has their well-defined jobs from which they rarely deviate. However, as one just starting out, I believe a small production may have been the best choice. Oh, the things I will learn!

But now, dear readers, I must retire. Your humble storyboard artist (and "Jill of all trades") was up until 3am last night/this morning, trying to complete as many stunt-related sketches before the tech scout today.

Who knows what adventures await me tomorrow- but you shall know soon after they occur!
