Arriving sometime in the first half of September: the practical family car, Anna's new 2007 Mini Cooper.

I really wanted to buy the Cooper S, but the lead time on orders is running about 4 months. There's no possible way we'll survive that long without a car. I'm surprised Anna's been able to get by without a car of her own for so long.

Of course, there was a sweet Laser Blue Cooper S with a white roof up in Tacoma, WA. But it was $6,000 more than we were prepared to spend. Damn Mini for being so popular!
