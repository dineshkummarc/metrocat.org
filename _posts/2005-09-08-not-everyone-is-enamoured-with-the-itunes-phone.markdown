Well, I'm a throwback too. After eight years of using only a cellphone, I'm enjoying being cellphone free (even if it will all come to an end in a month or so). Although if I could only find a phone I might consider it. Now they all have cameras, MP3 players, coffee makers, and eyebrow waxers thrown into the mix.

Go read [Jan's post](http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/08/i-dont-want-an-itunes-phone/) and you'll understand why.

**Update:** On the other hand, I would like to score one of the iPod nanos.
