Well, I am pleased to say that I have started my fitness program for 2005. I signed up for the local gym (Fitness Factory), tried my first spinning class (almost died), and had my first training session today. As embarrassed as I am to admit, it has been **11 and 1/2 _years_** since I have been in a regular gym program. Even more embarrassing is that Dad is a fitness trainer, and has been trying to get me to join a gym for nearly as long.

Need more details about my overall fitness plan? You got 'em! I resolve to:

1. Improve my eating habits:
  
    * Join [Weight Watchers][1] and stick to it! **Note: as of January 1, signed up.**
    * Eat more fruits and veggies!
    * Take my vitamins!
    * Reduce/elimate soda (January-March), and then reduce/eliminate caffeine intake (by end of May).
    * No McDonald's or similar "garbage" food. If need be, watch [Super Size Me][2] repeatedly until urge passes.
    * Speaking of Super Size Me, Morgan Spurlock (the director) and his fiancee, [Healthy Chef Alex][3], have inspired me to try my own culinary experiment. **In February, I will go Vegan for one month.** Sure, it's the shortest month of the year, but it still counts.

2. Get into action heroine physique by June 15th:
    * Join a gym. **Note: as of January 10, officially signed up.**
    * Go to gym every day. Cardio daily, weight/strength training every other day.
    * Work butt off. Sweat. Repeat.

3. Acquire new skills and develop old ones.

    <b>NEW</b>
    * Swimming. **Note: will join [YWCA ][4]for a class starting in February.**
    * Snowshoeing. **Note: will attend a clinic at [REI][5] this month.**
    * Kayaking. In the spring, I am certain the folks at REI will help.
    * Climbing. Did someone say REI?
    
    <b>OLD</b>
    * Yoga. Perhaps the [Yoga Center of Newburyport][6]? Perhaps I will wait for _prenatal_ yoga...
    * Horseback riding. I will give this one more thought. Perhaps I will just ride a couple of times now, and start lessons next year, after Wee Watkins is born.
    * Bellydance. I have DVDs and there are local classes a-plenty. Now, the question is, do I have the time?
    * Biking. Maybe those spinning classes will allow me to be able to ride this year, without panting and nearly passing out.
    * Hiking. Working out, I should finally be able to keep up with Jeff...
    * Walking. **Note: I am currently using a pedometer, and am working towards a goal of 10,000 steps (approx. 5 miles) a day, in addition to my regular workout!**

4. Improve my skin quality:
    * Lots of water! **Note: Still getting used to this "8 glasses a day" thing.**
    * Use only natural makeup, like [Aveda][7]. **Note: for those of you who might otherwise make a comment, I will be getting a "professional" makeup lesson later this month.**
    * Weekly exfoliation/rehydration, and perhaps (bi)monthly deep cleansing at a place like [Interlocks][8], a local spa.**Note: My birthday gift this year from Jeff was a gift certificate to this spa. I think I will reward myself for working out later this month, or the beginning of next!**

5. Improve my teeth:
    * Use my [sonic toothbrush][9] more often, instead of my regular one.
    * Remember to floss!
    * Have my teeth professionally whitened, or continue to use gentle products, such as [ this][10] from my favorite folks at [Toms of Maine][11].
    * At long last -- BRACES!

6. And finally, to learn how to dress in a _feminine_ manner, yet still remain tough and funky. I need help on this one. **Any suggestions? Please email me!**
