<p>Well, I am pleased to say that I have started my fitness program for
2005. I signed up for the local gym (Fitness Factory), tried my first
spinning class (almost died), and had my first training session today.
As embarrassed as I am to admit, it has been <b>11 and 1/2
<i>years</i></b> since I have been in a regular gym program. Even more
embarrassing is that Dad is a fitness trainer, and has been trying to
get me to join a gym for nearly as long.</p>
<p>Need more details about my overall fitness plan? You got 'em!
I resolve to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Improve my eating habits:</li>
    <br/></ol><ul><li>Join <a href="http://www.weightwatchers.com">Weight Watchers</a> and stick to it!
 <b>Note: as of January 1, signed up.</b></li>
    <li>Eat more fruits and veggies!</li>
    <li>Take my vitamins!</li>
    <li>Reduce/elimate soda (January-March), and then reduce/eliminate caffeine intake (by end of May).</li>
    <li>No McDonald's or similar "garbage" food. If need be, watch <a href="http://www.supersizeme.com">Super Size Me</a> repeatedly until urge passes.</li>
    <li>Speaking of Super Size Me, Morgan Spurlock (the director) and his fiancee, <a href="http://www.healthychefalex.com/index.htm">Healthy Chef Alex</a>, have inspired me to try my own culinary experiment. <b>In February, I will go Vegan for one month.</b> Sure, it's the shortest month of the year, but it still counts.</li>
    </ul><br><li>Get into action heroine physique by June 15th:</li><br><ul><li>Join a gym. <b>Note: as of January 10, officially signed up.</b></li>
    <li>Go to gym every day. Cardio daily, weight/strength training every other day.</li>
    <li>Work butt off. Sweat. Repeat.</li>
    </ul><br><li>Acquire new skills and develop old ones.</li><br><b>NEW</b><ul><li>Swimming. <b>Note: will join <a href="http://www.ywcanewburyport.org/">YWCA </a>for a class starting in February.</b></li>
    <li>Snowshoeing. <b>Note: will attend a clinic at <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a> this month.</b></li>
    <li>Kayaking. In the spring, I am certain the folks at REI will help.</li>
    <li>Climbing. Did someone say REI?</li>
    </ul><br><b>OLD</b><br><ul><li>Yoga. Perhaps the <a href="http://www.newburyportyoga.com/index.html">Yoga Center of Newburyport</a>? Perhaps I will wait for <i>prenatal</i> yoga...</li>
    <li>Horseback riding. I will give this one more thought. Perhaps I will just ride a couple of times now, and start lessons next year, after Wee Watkins is born.</li>
    <li>Bellydance. I have DVDs and there are local classes a-plenty. Now, the question is, do I have the time?</li>
    <li>Biking. Maybe those spinning classes will allow me to be able to ride this year, without panting and nearly passing out.</li>
    <li>Hiking. Working out, I should finally be able to keep up with Jeff...</li>
    <li>Walking. <b>Note: I am currently using a pedometer, and am working towards a goal of 10,000 steps (approx. 5 miles) a day, in addition to my regular workout!</b></li>
    </ul><br><li>Improve my skin quality:</li><br><ul><li>Lots of water! <b>Note: Still getting used to this "8 glasses a day" thing.</b></li>
    <li>Use only natural makeup, like <a href="http://www.aveda.com">Aveda</a>. <b>Note: for those of you who might otherwise make a comment, I will be getting a "professional" makeup lesson later this month.</b></li>
    <li>Weekly exfoliation/rehydration, and perhaps (bi)monthly deep cleansing at a place like <a href="http://www.interlockssalon.com/">Interlocks</a>, a local spa.<b>Note: My birthday gift this year from Jeff was a gift certificate to this spa. I think I will reward myself for working out later this month, or the beginning of next!</b></li>
    </ul><br><li>Improve my teeth:</li><br><ul><li>Use my <a href="http://www.sonicare.com/products/advance/4100.asp">sonic toothbrush</a> more often, instead of my regular one.</li>
    <li>Remember to floss!</li>
    <li>Have my teeth professionally whitened, or continue to use gentle products, such as <a href="http://www.tomsofmaine.com/toms/product.asp?dept%5Fid=400&pf%5Fid=TP%2DGEL%2DAGW"> this</a> from my favorite folks at <a href="https://www.tomsofmaine.com/">Toms of Maine</a>.</li>
    <li>At long last- BRACES!</li>
    </ul><br><li>And finally, to learn how to dress in a <i>feminine</i> manner, yet still remain tough and funky. I need help on this one. <b>Any suggestions? Please email me!</b></li>
