I am now on my third attempt to document my resolutions for this year. Ordinarily, I have very little difficulty coming up with a list of ten things I would like to do or change, and all of the minutiae associated with each one. 

There are usually one or two resolutions that make the list every year, which tells you something about my ability to actually follow through on these things. 

This year in particular I actually have someone keeping score, although she doesn't even know she is. Her name is Molly. It has occurred to me, in many a moment of panic, that <i>she is watching my every move</i> and learning from everything I do or don't do. Santa isn't that vigilant; and at worst he just delivers coal. My daughter might require me to pay for her medical bills or therapy <i>for the rest of her life</i>.
 
Therefore, I refuse to make promises I might not keep. With this exception:

Dear Molly, 

I resolve to make every effort not to damage your body or your mind too badly in 2006.

Love, Mama

P.S. This is called <i>humor</i>. Just in case those who read this post have none and take offense.
